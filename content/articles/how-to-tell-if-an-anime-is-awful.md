title: How to Tell if an Anime is Awful
summary: "There's a lot of terrible anime out there. Vanishing budgets, increasing production costs, and fierce competition mean that only tried-and-true formulas are approved. But those once-novel formulas are so played out that, more often than not, their presence is indicative that the anime you're watching is not worth the time. Here are some common themes to watch out for."

## Disclaimers
* I'm an anime fan and I love the medium. Please read the post before commenting.
* If I critique your favorite anime, I'm not attacking you personally.
* I'm not pining for "the good old days" of anime. I just want creative people to be allowed to take risks.
* This isn't going to be a post about how anime is "toxic" or "harmful". There *are* certain aspects of it that make me uncomfortable, but as someone who's not japanese, I think [it's a little ignorant to call anime as a whole "insensitive" and "unacceptable" when I don't have any first hand experience of the cultural context](https://www.grandartsgazette.com/reviews/2020/1/30/anime-sucks-and-heres-why). There's a fine line between critique and claiming moral superiority :eyeroll:

## Required Reading: Why Does a lot of Anime Suck?
Nobody plans from the start to create something awful. Ignoring trolls and memes, I think that most failed artistic endeavors are due to unintentional failure. Whether it's a lack of skill, time, or money, there are *many* things that can go wrong. But it's my firm belief that, no matter what your credentials are, how much money you have, or how misguided you might be, everyone should be allowed to try to express themselves artistically.

### Anime is Hard and Expensive
**But the problem with anime is that it's very, very hard to make**. As the medium has evolved and technology has advanced, your average consumer has become very picky about their animation. They've probably seen movies like [Into the Spiderverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4Hbz2jLxvQ), or maybe they've seen lovingly-crafted anime like [Space Dandy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxe15A-Vk28). Both are examples that raise the artistic bar and elevate their respective medium. But as the bar rises, so do consumers' expectations. 

Unfortunately, your average anime fan probably doesn't know anything about about the difficulties of producing 24 minutes of fully-animated, fully voiced animation. As a result, when your average anime fan sees [anime that looks like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHPFD0-bXhE), they think, "this is low budget trash!", and I think that's a little unfair (although seriously, that scene fails on a number of artistic and technical levels). 

Consumers' increasing expectations of animation has hit the anime industry particularly hard, as the medium was [originally designed around beautiful, artistic background imagery first, and animation second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime#History). It's really difficult to animate detailed artwork, so to compensate, anime has typically employed limited animations, and sometimes no animation at all, except for important, action-oriented scenes. 

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="limitedMedium" :src="'/eva.jpg'" />
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Neon Genesis: Evangelion has very intricate artwork, but stiff animation. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I'd argue that it's just a characteristic of the medium. <a href="https://wiki.evageeks.org/File:01_C300_eva01-plug.jpg">Image Source</a></span>
</div>

So unlike western animation, which tends to be "animation first, details second", this upwards shift in consumer expectations puts the anime industry between a rock and a hard place: **how do anime creatives stay true to the roots of anime, while keeping up with consumer expectations, without spending boatloads of money?**

The short answer is: they can't. They need to spend lots of money in order to keep up with consumer expectations. See the following excerpt from a report written by the Association of Japanese Animations (AJA). Note that English reads a little strangely (the full report is in Japanese, while only the summary is in English), but the point is definitely clear:

<info-box :source-name="'Anime Industry Report 2018 Summary'" :source-link="'https://aja.gr.jp/download/anime_ind_rpt2018_summary_en-2?wpdmdl=1407&refresh=5fba9768b7b7e1606063976'">
[T]here is a strong demand for higher quality of animations. It is also evidence of growing understanding for the situation. Yet some animation studios which fail to match the required quality may face the risk of failure if they are late to improve productivity...on the other hand, some say the production costs of certain works are pushed up due to the entry of new players, including domestic game companies, Netflix, Amazon and Chinese businesses.
</info-box>

In other words, in order to keep up with expectations and to remain competitive, Japanese animation studios can't simply fall back to their old ways of still-frame lip-flapping and stiff, choppy animation. But that means they need to spend a lot of money. In fact, as the quote above suggests, they need to spend much more money than they were previously spending.

If you weren't paying attention, then here's the main point: **aanime is getting more and more expensive, so these studios can't afford to take risks. They need to rely on tried-and-true narratives and merchandising schemes to make money**. And this is a problem because it's bringing the entire industry down with it.

### Anime is Getting Lazy
Consumers expect great production values. Therefore, production costs for anime are rising. Because production costs are rising, the anime industry can't afford to take risks, as a single failure can take out an entire studio. So these creatives are forced to rely on established conventions that cater to very specific fanbases in order to recoup their very-high production costs.

On that last point, esteemed anime critic Digi (formerly Digibro) made an [excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzocnfLccs8) complaining about this very topic, so I won't get into it. Instead, I recommend you watch his video, because he's much funnier and smarter than I am.

But the short synopsis is that **anime is lazy**, and has been for a few decades. Narrative and character conventions were established and experimented with up until the 90's, and then largely stagnated as budgets dried up and/or costs hav skyrocketed. Now, there's an over-reliance on painfully uninteresting conventions and tropes. For the rest of this post, I'll get into what I think are some of the biggest offenders.

Note that, in the next section, I'm speaking in general terms. **Not all current anime is bad**. And even if I mention an anime as a "main offender", it does not mean that it's without merit. I simply think that some of its content or conventions detract from its overall presentation.

## Waifu War Baiting
**Recent Main offenders**: 
* Re:Zero âˆ’ Starting Life in Another World
* The "Fate" Series
* My Hero: Academia

For those that don't know, "Waifu" is a term used to refer to a female character that you (as a fan of the anime) consider to be "wife material" ("waifu" being a phonetically-japanese pronunciation of the word "wife"). And as fanbases do, they sometimes get into debates about which waifu is best. I don't engage in these debates, but as an outsider, I consider them to be harmless fun, and I don't see an issue. You may cry "female objectification", but [women do the same thing](http://www.dailytoreador.com/archives/twilight-objectifies-men/article_ec0aff2e-32da-516d-b826-da34c1e5be6c.html), and as long as we all recognize that real human beings should be treated with much more respect than these fictional characters, then I see no harm.

And to be honest, there's nothing wrong with admiring a character, male or female, from an anime.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="limitedMedium" :src="'/casca.JPG'" />
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Casca from Berserk is an awesome female character. Complex, interesting, and someone you want to root for, even when things go horribly wrong. And they do.</span>
</div>

But the anime industry has taken notice of this: they've noticed all of the merchandise being purchased of the fans' favorite waifus. They've seen the figurines, posters, and body-pillows fly off store shelves. It's a fact that [character merchandising makes up a significant portion of the industry's overall revenue](https://aja.gr.jp/download/anime-industry-report-2019-summary_?wpdmdl=1625&refresh=5fbac18932e071606074761). 

So I don't think it's a coincidence that a lot of shows in recent memory introduce an unnecessary amount of female characters that fit a bunch of different stereotypes that allow fans to align themselves to a specific faction of "waifu", such as:
* the quiet, shy waifu
* the fiery, short-tempered waifu
* the childhood friend waifu
* the friendly, outgoing waifu
* the mysterious, possibly psycho-killer waifu
* the innocent, yet finds themselves in compromising situations, waifu

And it's *also* no coincidence that these female characters usually cover most of the romantic preferences of your average heterosexual male viewer, as well. Quiet girls, energetic girls, etc. Any preference that a male viewer might have is usually covered, which usually subconsciously increases their investment into their waifu faction. It's exploitative and gross, but it's *genius*. 

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="" :src="'/waifu.jpg'" />
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Re: Zero, everyone. The waifu gang is all here. Pick a side, fight to death, and more importantly, buy as many wall scrolls and figurines as you can!</span>
</div>

Before you call me a stick the mud, let me preempt you by saying that there's nothing wrong with escapism. If you want to immerse yourself in a fiction about a bunch of exotic women (or men, if you prefer), then that's fine! And if that's [the explicit point of the work itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quintessential_Quintuplets), then even better! If the point of the work is romance, comedy, titillation, or any combination of those three, then I don't necessarily see an issue.

But if you're an anime creative, and you're trying to sell me a mature story about a young male protagonist that has the fate of the world on his shoulders, but the cast includes a waifu of every variety, and each waifu gets an equal amount of screen time alone with him that does nothing but appease its respective "waifu faction", then I'm sorry, anime creative. Your narrative has been hijacked by salesmen to appease the hyper-specific part of the fanbase that spends $1000's of dollars on waifu figurines. Your narrative and pacing is going to suffer, and it will be impossible to elevate your story beyond "guilty pleasure nonsense". 

And from a maturity perspective, it's just kind of embarrassing. Let me put it this way: with all of its cute waifu antics going on, would anyone feel even remotely comfortable showing Re: Zero to their parents? Or a friend not interested in anime? I think we both know the answer to that question (it's "no").

For what it's worth (I have no data for this), I don't think it's due to a cultural misunderstanding. I think most people, japanese or otherwise, can see the gratuitous fanservice, the many cleavage and panty shots, and the wide variety of women in something like "Re: Zero" for what it is: pointless, random waifu bait that exists to rev up its viewers that's in direct disservice of the plot. Because time doesn't exist in a vacuum: you're either spending time building your narrative and your world, or you're trying to get me hooked on a waifu so that I buy merchandise. I'll admit that you can do both some of the time, but *you can't do both all of the time*. 

Therefore, if you find yourself watching a show where the main character finds themselves surrounded by a bunch of women who fit different, specific stereotypes, all vying for attention, and the genre *isn't* a romantic comedy or harem-type show, do yourself a favor and avoid it. It exists to sell merchandise, and there's probably anime out there with *much* better stories to tell.

**Remediation: If the anime industry needs to capitalize on selling character merchandise to stay afloat, at least make the characters interesting.** Stop relying on the same damn archetypes we've seen a million times before. Make your characters something other than "the cute shy one" or the "bruised, untrusting one".

The *real* solution is to stop making characters that serve a monetary purpose, but the anime industry is *an industry* after all, and people need to make money, which I understand. So I don't see this as a viable solution.

## The Constant Need to Explain Motivations
**Recent Main offenders:**
* Re:Zero âˆ’ Starting Life in Another World
* My Hero: Academia
* Every Single goddamned Anime-themed Videogame I've every played (i.e. Tales of Berseria)
* Too many others to mention
    
This problem is not necessarily unique to anime, but for some reason, I've found that it hits anime the hardest. 

How many times have you heard some variation of the following phrase uttered by either a main character or secondary character in an anime:

* "I've finally figured out that my life path is..."
* "...and that is what I believe!"
* "...and this is why I fight! And I'll never stop until I...

The list could go on. It really could. Anime characters seem to never stop chirping about their life path, about how they don't have one, or about how they've discovered one, or about how they'll never waver from it. **It just never stops**.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="" :src="'/berseria.jpg'" />
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">A fun game, especially with a friend, but Tales of Berseria is terrible at this: every character constantly spells out what they're motivated by.</span>
</div>

But that's just anime, right? Hahaha, good old anime! So quirky, but we love you anyway!

Actually, this critique is indicative of a major problem in the way that anime tells its stories, in that it commits one of the *deadly sins of storytelling*: **show, don't tell**. 

I could write an entirely seperate post on the narrative benefits of showing, rather than telling, but the short summary is:
* **Showing** allows the viewer to build a mental model of the character in their head. It makes the character more believable, and increases immersion.
* **Telling** requires the viewer to suspend their disbelief. The viewer simply has to accept the words that the character is saying at face value (i.e. "my life path is..")

Mainstream anime is absolutely awful at this. My Hero Academia is particular awful at this. Subaru from Re: Zero is awful at this. Naruto is awful at this. Lots of anime is awful at this. 

When you tell, and don't show, characters ring hollow. There's no weight behind their proclamations of duty, or their lifelong passions. You just kinda have to nod your head and accept it. 

Or maybe you missed some important scene that made sense of everything. Maybe you slept through an episode or two and forgot about it? Nope, that's what happens when characters tell us who they are, instead of showing us who they are through their actions.

But there's a reason why anime studios do this: **it's easier and cheaper to tell, rather than show**. Why bother animating an episode *showing* why a main character has difficulty trusting others? Instead, you can just dedicate 90 second to a flashback scene of still-frames, and have the character *tell* the audience why they have trust issues while sad music plays in the background. How emotional! Now, the character's trust issues make sense!

Showing is obviously harder to do: it requires more time and more skill, and the consequences for doing it incorrectly are dire (i.e. "that seemed out-of-character for her"). But when done well, it makes for amazing, interesting, lovable characters.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="limitedMedium" :src="'/spike.jpg'" />
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Spike from Cowboy Bebop is a great subversion. He claims to be "just a simple bounty hunter", but the anime shows us that that's not quite true.</span>
</div>

**Remediation: Anime needs to have more faith in its viewers.** Its audience is growing up. If a show is marketed towards children, then explain everything and anything you need to. But for all other types of shows, give your audience the respect it deserves.

## Not Knowing When to Shut Up
I played the trumpet for 12 years. I was never amazing, but one of my favorite memories of college was playing in our school's jazz ensemble. And during rehearsal, someone mentioned a quote from Miles Davis, a famous Jazz Trumpet player, that went something like this: "You gotta know when to put the fucking horn down".

To elaborate: in jazz, solos are improvised, and are sometimes of indeterminate length. You just kinda *feel it out*. Part of the skill of the soloist is knowing *exactly* how long your solo needs to be, for that specific vibe, for that specific moment. Davis' quote was directed towards a specific soloist (I think Jonathan Coltrane) who was simply soloing for simply too long.

Despite being a misquote (the real quote is something slightly different), it has stuck with me since that day because I've noticed that it can be applied to *many* different art forms. 

Whether it's music, movies, paintings, and espeicially anime, when artists attempt to constantly bombard the audience with emotions, visuals, sounds, twists, and turns, audiences get overwhelmed and fatigued. Sights and sounds pass by so quickly that they're here and gone in an instant, unable to be appreciated by anyone.



## Bonus List: Things that Shouldn't Be Dealbreakers
1. **CGI**: as if you didn't already know, anime is expensive. In that sense, I consider CGI as an enabler. It allows studios with smaller budgets to create things that they wouldn't normally be able to create with traditional hand-drawn animation. So just because something has janky CGI, doesn't necessarily mean that it's terrible (although I genuinely thought that Zombieland Saga was medicore).
2. **Fanservice**: despite what you might think based on what I've written above, I don't think fanservice is inherently bad. If it makes sense for the work in question, then I think it's fine. In other words, if it makes sense for the genre (i.e. haram, romance, etc), or if it makes in the narrative (main character gets seduced), or if it fits the aesthetic (i.e. Space Dandy), then I don't see any issue with it.
3. **Cute Characters Doing Cute Things**: For me, personally, this is a cultural barrier that I can't seem to cross. I simply don't understand the appeal of a show about a group of cute characters doing nothing but futzing around, doing cute things, like starting a band, or participating in after-school clubs. But there's obviously a huge appeal to a lot of people. So I won't simply trash something that I don't understand.
