title: How to Tell if an Anime is Awful
summary: "There's a lot of terrible anime out there. Vanishing budgets, increasing production costs, and fierce competition mean that only tried-and-true formulas are approved. But those once-novel formulas are so played out that, more often than not, their presence is indicative that the anime you're watching is not worth the time. Here are some common themes to watch out for."

## Disclaimers
### You Should Know
* I'm an anime fan and I love the medium. Please read the post before commenting.
* If I critique your favorite anime, I'm not attacking you personally.
* This isn't going to be a post about how anime is "toxic" or "harmful". There *are* certain aspects of it that make me uncomfortable, but as someone who's not japanese, I think [it's a little ignorant to call anime as a whole "insensitive" and "unacceptable" when I don't have any first hand experience of the cultural context](https://www.grandartsgazette.com/reviews/2020/1/30/anime-sucks-and-heres-why). There's a fine line between critique and claiming moral superiority :eyeroll:

### What This Post Aims To Achieve
I'm not simply going to point out common [tropes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trope_(literature)) and jeer, "Haha, look at these things that anime does! Isn't anime dumb?!". Recurring patterns in art does not make that artform invalid: for example, just because songs utilize [those four chords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ) doesn't mean that they're lame. But there ARE certain musical patterns that ARE lame AND overused AND need correcting.

Therefore, I'm going to try to accomplish the following:

- Explain why anime made within the past few years tends to all rely on the same tired cliches
- Explain why these cliches are used
- Explain why they make things suck
- Offer possible alternatives to accomplish similar narrative objectives

## Required Reading: Why Does a lot of Anime Suck?
Nobody plans from the start to create something awful. Ignoring trolls and memes, I think that most failed artistic endeavors are due to unintentional failure. Whether it's a lack of skill, time, or money, there are *many* things that can go wrong. But it's my firm belief that, no matter what your credentials are, how much money you have, or how misguided you might be, everyone should be allowed to try to express themselves artistically.

### Anime is Hard and Expensive
**But the problem with anime is that it's very, very hard to make**. As the medium has evolved and technology has advanced, your average consumer has become very picky about their animation. They've probably seen movies like [Into the Spiderverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4Hbz2jLxvQ), or maybe they've seen lovingly-crafted anime like [Space Dandy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxe15A-Vk28). Both are examples that raise the artistic bar and elevate their respective medium. But as the bar rises, so do consumers' expectations. 

Unfortunately, your average anime fan probably doesn't know anything about about the difficulties of producing 24 minutes of fully-animated, fully voiced animation. As a result, when your average anime fan sees [anime that looks like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHPFD0-bXhE), they think, "this is low budget trash!", and I think that's a little unfair (although seriously, that scene fails on a number of artistic and technical levels). 

Consumers' increasing expectations of animation has hit the anime industry particularly hard, as the medium was [originally designed around beautiful, artistic background imagery first, and animation second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime#History). It's really difficult to animate detailed artwork, so to compensate, anime has typically employed limited animations, and sometimes no animation at all, except for important, action-oriented scenes. 

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="limitedMedium" :src="'/eva.jpg'" />
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Neon Genesis: Evangelion has very intricate artwork, but stiff animation. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I'd argue that it's just a characteristic of the medium. <a href="https://wiki.evageeks.org/File:01_C300_eva01-plug.jpg">Image Source</a></span>
</div>

So unlike western animation, which tends to be "animation first, details second", this upwards shift in consumer expectations puts the anime industry between a rock and a hard place: **how do anime creatives stay true to the roots of anime, while keeping up with consumer expectations, without spending boatloads of money?**

The short answer is: they can't. They need to spend lots of money in order to keep up with consumer expectations. See the following excerpt from a report written by the Association of Japanese Animations (AJA). Note that English reads a little strangely (the full report is in Japanese, while only the summary is in English), but the point is definitely clear:

<info-box :source-name="'Anime Industry Report 2018 Summary'" :source-link="'https://aja.gr.jp/download/anime_ind_rpt2018_summary_en-2?wpdmdl=1407&refresh=5fba9768b7b7e1606063976'">
[T]here is a strong demand for higher quality of animations. It is also evidence of growing understanding for the situation. Yet some animation studios which fail to match the required quality may face the risk of failure if they are late to improve productivity...on the other hand, some say the production costs of certain works are pushed up due to the entry of new players, including domestic game companies, Netflix, Amazon and Chinese businesses.
</info-box>

In other words, in order to keep up with expectations and to remain competitive, Japanese animation studios can't simply fall back to their old ways of still-frame lip-flapping and stiff, choppy animation. But that means they need to spend a lot of money. In fact, as the quote above suggests, they need to spend much more money than they were previously spending.

If you weren't paying attention, then here's the main point: **aanime is getting more and more expensive, so these studios can't afford to take risks. They need to rely on tried-and-true narratives and merchandising schemes to make money**. And this is a problem because it's bringing the entire industry down with it.

### Anime is Getting Lazy
Consumers expect great production values. Therefore, production costs for anime are rising. Because production costs are rising, the anime industry can't afford to take risks, as a single failure can take out an entire studio. So these creatives are forced to rely on established conventions that cater to very specific fanbases in order to recoup their very-high production costs.

On that last point, esteemed anime critic Digi (formerly Digibro) made an [excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzocnfLccs8) complaining about this very topic, so I won't get into it. Instead, I recommend you watch his video, because he's much funnier and smarter than I am.

But the short synopsis is that **anime is lazy**, and has been for a few decades. Narrative and character conventions were established and experimented with up until the 90's, and then largely stagnated as budgets dried up. Now, there's an over-reliance on painfully uninteresting conventions and tropes. For the rest of this post, I'll get into what I think are some of the biggest offenders.

## "Waifu-War" Baiting
**Main offenders: **
For those that don't know, "Waifu" is a term used to refer to a female character that you (as a fan of the anime) consider to be "wife material" ("waifu" being a phonetically-japanese pronunciation of the word "wife"). And as fanbases do, they sometimes get into arguments (mostly tongue-in-cheek) about which "waifu" is "best girl". I don't engage in this practice myself, but as an outsider, I consider this to be harmless fun when practiced in moderation.

And to be honest, there's nothing wrong with admiring a character, male or female, from an anime or otherwise.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="limitedMedium" :src="'/casca.JPG'" />
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Casca from Berserk is an awesome female character. Complex, interesting, and someone you want to root for, even when things go horribly wrong. And they do.</span>
</div>

But the anime industry has taken notice of this: they've noticed all of the merchandise being purchased of the fans' favorite waifus. They've seen the figurines, posters, and body-pillows fly off store shelves. It's a fact that [character merchandising makes up a significant portion of the overall revenue that the anime industry makes](https://aja.gr.jp/download/anime-industry-report-2019-summary_?wpdmdl=1625&refresh=5fbac18932e071606074761). 

So I don't think it's a coincidence that a lot of shows in recent memory introduce an unnecessary amount of female characters that fit a bunch of different stereotypes that allow fans to align themselves to a specific faction of "waifu", such as:
* the quiet, shy waifu
* the fiery, short-tempered waifu
* the childhood friend waifu
* the friendly, outgoing waifu
* the innocent waifu that inexplicably finds themselves in compromising situations

The main character, always male, has ambiguously romantic feelings for all of the characters. Nevertheless, the romance has no relation to the actual plot or message of the show. It's a sexist ploy that exists merely to sell merchandise. And as a result, the narrative structure of the anime suffers 

Therefore, if you find yourself watching a show where the main character finds themselves surrounded by a bunch of women who all fit a specific stereotype, all vying for attention, and the genre *isn't* a romantic comedy or harem-type show, do yourself a favor and avoid it. It exists to sell body pillows.
