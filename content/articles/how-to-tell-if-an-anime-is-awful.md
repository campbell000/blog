title: How to Tell if an Anime is Awful
summary: "Anime in 2020 is mostly awful. Vanishing budgets and dwindling viewship numbers mean that only tried-and-true formulas are approved. But those once-novel formulas are so played out that, more often than not, their presence are indicative that the anime you're watching is not worth the time. Here are some common tropes to watch out for."

## Disclaimers
* If I critique your favorite anime, I'm not attacking you personally.
* Just because your opinions differ than mine, doesn't mean that your opinions are invalid.
* It's just anime. Relax, take a deep breath, and try to laugh.
* This isn't going to be a post about how "toxic" or "harmful" certain tropes in anime are. There *are* certain things in anime that make me uncomfortable, but as someone who's non-japanese, I think [it's a little ignorant to call anime as a whole "insensitive" and "unacceptable" when I don't have any first hand experience of the cultural context](https://www.grandartsgazette.com/reviews/2020/1/30/anime-sucks-and-heres-why).
* I've watched a ton of [Digi's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHhnf3RgHabfk5f2gUX6EVQ) videos. When I make blog posts, I try not to simply regurgitate other people's content, but it's possible that I might subconsciously repeat some of his points. 

## What This Post Aims To Achieve
I'm not simply going to point out common tropes and go, "Haha, look at this common thing! Isn't all anime bad?!". Instead, I'm going to try to accomplish the following:

- Point out common tropes that are too heavily relied on
- Explain why they're used, and why they're overused
- Explain why they make things suck
- Offer possible alternatives to accomplish similar narrative objectives without relying so heavily on overdone tropes

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills.
