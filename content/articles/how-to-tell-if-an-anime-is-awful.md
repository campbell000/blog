title: How to Tell if an Anime is Awful
summary: "There's a lot of terrible anime out there. Vanishing budgets, increasing production costs, and fierce competition mean that only tried-and-true formulas are approved. But those once-novel formulas are so played out that, more often than not, their presence is indicative that the anime you're watching is not worth the time. Here are three themes to watch out for."

## Disclaimers
* I'm an anime fan and I love the medium. Please read the post before commenting.
* If I critique your favorite anime, I'm not attacking you personally.
* I'm not pining for "the good old days" of anime. I just want creative people to be allowed to take risks.
* This isn't going to be a post about how anime is "toxic". There *are* certain aspects of it that make me uncomfortable, but as someone who's not japanese, I think [it's a little ignorant to call anime as a whole "insensitive" and "unacceptable" when I don't have any first hand experience of the cultural context](https://www.grandartsgazette.com/reviews/2020/1/30/anime-sucks-and-heres-why). There's a fine line between critique and claiming moral superiority :eyeroll:

## Required Reading: Why Does a lot of Anime Suck?
Nobody plans from the start to create something awful. Ignoring trolls and memes, I think that most failed artistic endeavors are due to unintentional failure. Whether it's a lack of skill, time, or money, there are *many* things that can go wrong. But it's my firm belief that, no matter what your credentials are, how much money you have, or how misguided you might be, everyone should be allowed to try to express themselves artistically.

### Anime is Hard and Expensive
**The primary reason why we end up with bad anime is because anime is very, very hard to make**. As the medium has evolved and technology has advanced, your average consumer has become very picky about their animation. They've probably seen movies like [Into the Spiderverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4Hbz2jLxvQ), or maybe they've seen lovingly-crafted works like [Space Dandy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxe15A-Vk28). Both are examples that raise the artistic bar and elevate their respective medium. But as the bar rises, so do consumers' expectations. 

Unfortunately, your average anime fan probably doesn't know anything about about the difficulties of producing 24 minutes of fully-animated, fully voiced animation. As a result, when that same anime fan watches an [anime that looks like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHPFD0-bXhE), they'll likely think, "wow, this is low budget trash!", and I think that's a little unfair (although seriously, that scene fails on a number of artistic and technical levels). 

Consumers' increasing expectations of animation has hit the anime industry particularly hard, as the medium was [originally designed around beautiful, artistic designs first, and animation second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime#History), which is quite different than western animation. Take a look at the comparison I made below:

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="" :src="'/wesjap.jpg'" />
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">For those that don't know, the left is Naruto, and the right is Timmy from "The Fairly Odd Parents", a very popular American Animated TV show.</span>
</div>

Notice how Naruto's design is much more detailed: his hands are drawn much more accurately, his clothing has shading and folds much more realistically, his proportions are more accurate, and in general, there's much more to his design than Timmy's.

But as a result of "The Fairly Odd Parents" characters' simpler designs, the character animations in that show are *much* more fluid and expressive than Naruto's, and character's mouths will actually be synched to their dialog. In general, when designs are simpler, they're easier and cheaper to animate. 

Whereas in Naruto, save for special fight scenes and climatic moments, you'll often see examples of the following:
- Stiff, one-or-two frames of animation
- Still-frames with no animation, or with only pannings of the camera
- Re-used animations and scenes from earlier episodes
- Simple "lip-flapping" instead of proper lip-syncing to spoken dialog.

This isn't a condemnation of anime *or* western animation. Rather, this is just a frank analysis of how each type of animation chooses to deal with the reality of limited time and budgets. Western animation has handled this limitation via simplistic character designs that are easy to animate, while anime has done the opposite: appealing character designs with limited animation.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="limitedMedium" :src="'/eva.jpg'" />
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Neon Genesis: Evangelion has very intricate artwork, but stiff animation. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I'd argue that it's just a characteristic of the medium. <a href="https://wiki.evageeks.org/File:01_C300_eva01-plug.jpg">Image Source</a></span>
</div>

**But as I've stated above, consumers are starting to tolerate the limited animation techniques of anime less and less.** So unlike western animation, which tends to be "animation first, details second", this upwards shift in consumer expectations puts the anime industry between a rock and a hard place: how do anime creatives stay true to the roots of anime, which emphasizes detailed artwork and intricate designs, while keeping up with consumer expectations without spending boatloads of money?

The short answer is: they can't. They need to spend lots of money in order to keep up with consumer expectations. See the following excerpt from a report written by the Association of Japanese Animations (AJA):

<info-box :source-name="'Anime Industry Report 2018 Summary'" :source-link="'https://aja.gr.jp/download/anime_ind_rpt2018_summary_en-2?wpdmdl=1407&refresh=5fba9768b7b7e1606063976'">
[T]here is a strong demand for higher quality of animations. It is also evidence of growing understanding for the situation. Yet some animation studios which fail to match the required quality may face the risk of failure if they are late to improve productivity...on the other hand, some say the production costs of certain works are pushed up due to the entry of new players, including domestic game companies, Netflix, Amazon and Chinese businesses.
</info-box>

In other words, in order to keep up with expectations and to remain competitive, Japanese animation studios can't simply fall back to their old ways of still-frame lip-flapping and stiff, choppy animation. In fact, as the quote above suggests, they need to spend much more money than they were previously spending.

### The Bigger They Are, The Harder They Fall
Therefore, anime production studios have been feeling the pressure to spend more money to keep up with consumer expectations, as well as competition from global giants like netflix and amazon. But these decisions to spend more money don't simply exist in a vacuum. When anime becomes more expensive to make, it means that studios can't make as many shows. And when a studio can't make as many shows, it means that they have less tolerance for any one show to perform poorly. Consider the following examples:
* Studio A produces 10 shows, and 2 flop
* Studio B produces 5 shows, and 2 flop

Relative to studio A, studio B is in trouble because 40% of their shows have flopped, compared to A's 20%.

What's the big deal, you might ask? Well, **when a studio literally can't afford to risk failure, then they'll be pressured to stick with well-known, established money-making formulas instead of taking creative risks**. They'll be forced to make decisions that make the studio money, rather than decisions that serve the story that they're trying to tell. Or worse: they'll simply churn out stories and narratives that they have no interest in telling in the first place, just so they can fund the shows they want to produce).

This has had a drastic impact on the anime industry: I don't think it takes a university-funded research grant to deduce that, because of this, your average anime season now typically looks like:
* Dozens of cheaply-produced light-novel adaptations
* Romantic-comedy harems
* Videogame / High-fantasy / "Isekai"
* Videogame / High-fantasy / "Isakai", but subverted for comedic effect

These ideas were once novel and exciting. But now they're not. We see these kinds of show every single anime season, with the same kinds of "safe" character archetypes, conventions, and plot beats. This isn't because the anime industry has "lost its touch": I'm sure that there's just as many eager, creative young people in the industry today as there was in the 80's, 90's and 2000's. But the cost of failure is much higher. So, as a result, we get several romantic comedy harems every season because they tend to be an easy sell to the otaku audience, who also tend to buy merchandise (figurines, expensive blue-rays, etc).

So, while I don't think that most of these show's creators set out to make souless, vapid anime, I think that many of their production companies have lost sight over what actually makes anime *good* versus what makes them money. I think that *many* popular, mainstream anime have fallen victim to the pressures of making money, albeit (ironically) at the expense of their own show's quality

## How To Tell if An Anime is Awful
So, how can you tell if an anime is going to be awful? Simply relying on a trope or convention of a genre is not, by itself, a problem: art is transformative, owing to humans' natural instinct to communicate and share ideas. Just because, for example, an anime character fits a certain archetype (such as a [Tsundere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundere)) doesn't mean the character is bland or boring. When a work relies on established conventions of a medium, viewers are able to immediately make assumptions about a character, which the anime can either confirm (which pleases viewers), or subvert (which surprises viewers, which the anime can use for narrative purposes).

But in this post, I'm going to argue that there are certain conventions and tropes that have made their way into modern anime that *simply exist to make money*. In fact, their mere existence actually *detracts* from the narrative as a whole. I will focus on three major examples below:

### Waifu Baiting
**Recent Main offenders**: 
* Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World
* The "Fate" Series
* My Hero: Academia

For those that don't know, "Waifu" is a term used to refer to a female character that one would consider to be "wife material" ("waifu" being a phonetically-japanese pronunciation of the word "wife"). And as fanbases do, they sometimes get into debates about which waifu is best. I don't engage in these debates, but as an outsider, I consider them to be harmless fun, and I don't see an issue. You may cry "female objectification", but [women do the same thing](http://www.dailytoreador.com/archives/twilight-objectifies-men/article_ec0aff2e-32da-516d-b826-da34c1e5be6c.html), and as long as we all recognize that real human beings should be treated with much more respect than these fictional characters, then I see no harm.

And to be honest, there's nothing wrong with admiring a character, male or female, from an anime.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="limitedMedium" :src="'/casca.JPG'" />
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Casca from Berserk is an awesome female character. Complex, interesting, and someone you want to root for, even when things go horribly wrong. And they do.</span>
</div>

But the anime industry has taken notice of this: they've taken stock of all of the merchandise being purchased of the fans' favorite waifus. They've seen the figurines, posters, and body-pillows fly off (virtual) store shelves. It's a fact that [character merchandising makes up a significant portion of the industry's overall revenue](https://aja.gr.jp/download/anime-industry-report-2019-summary_?wpdmdl=1625&refresh=5fbac18932e071606074761)

So I don't think it's a coincidence that a lot of shows in recent memory introduce an unnecessary amount of female characters that fit a bunch of different stereotypes that allow fans to align themselves to a specific faction of "waifu", such as:
* the quiet, shy waifu
* the fiery, short-tempered waifu
* the childhood friend waifu
* the friendly, outgoing waifu
* the mysterious, possibly psycho-killer waifu
* the innocent, yet finds themselves in compromising situations, waifu

And it's *also* no coincidence that these female characters usually cover most of the romantic preferences of your average heterosexual male viewer, as well. Quiet girls, energetic girls, etc. Any preference that a male viewer might have is usually covered, which undoubtedly increases their attachment to their waifus, leading them to spend more money. It's exploitative, sexist, and gross, but it's *genius*. 

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="" :src="'/waifu.jpg'" />
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Re: Zero, everyone. The waifu gang is all here. Pick a side, fight to death, and more importantly, buy as many wall scrolls and figurines as you can!</span>
</div>

Before you call me a stick the mud, let me preempt you by saying that there's nothing wrong with escapism. If you want to immerse yourself in a fiction about a bunch of exotic women (or men, if you prefer), then that's fine! And if that's [the explicit point of the work itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quintessential_Quintuplets), then even better! If the point of the work is romance, comedy, titillation, or any combination of those three, then I don't necessarily see an issue.

But if you're an anime creative, and you're trying to sell me a mature story about a young male protagonist that has the fate of the world on his shoulders, but the cast includes a waifu of every variety, and each waifu gets an equal amount of screen time alone with him that does nothing but appease its respective "waifu faction", then I'm sorry, anime creative. Your narrative has been hijacked by salesmen to appease the hyper-specific part of the fanbase that spends $1000's of dollars on waifu figurines. Your narrative and pacing is going to suffer, and it will be impossible to elevate your story beyond "guilty pleasure nonsense". 

And from a maturity perspective, it's just simply embarrassing. Let me put it this way: with all of its cute waifu antics going on, would anyone feel even remotely comfortable showing Re: Zero to their parents? Or a friend not interested in anime? I think we both know the answer to that question (it's "no").

For what it's worth (I have no data for this), I don't think this critique of mine is a "western" complaint. I think most people, japanese or otherwise, can see the gratuitous fanservice, the many cleavage and panty shots, and the wide variety of women in something like "Re: Zero" for what it is: pointless, random waifu bait that exists to rev up its viewers that's in direct disservice of the plot. Because time doesn't exist in a vacuum: you're either spending time building your narrative and your world, or you're trying to get me hooked on a waifu so that I buy merchandise. I'll admit that you can do both some of the time, but *you can't do both all of the time*. 

Therefore, if you find yourself watching a show where the main character finds themselves surrounded by a bunch of women who fit different, specific stereotypes, all vying for attention, and the genre *isn't* a romantic comedy or harem-type show, do yourself a favor and avoid it. It exists to sell merchandise, and there's probably anime out there with *much* better stories to tell.

**Remediation: If the anime industry needs to capitalize on selling character merchandise to stay afloat, at least make the characters interesting.** Stop relying on the same damn archetypes we've seen a million times before. Make your characters something other than "the cute shy one" or the "bruised, untrusting one".

The *real* solution is to stop adding characters (usually female) that serve a monetary purpose, but the anime industry is *an industry* after all, and people need to make money, which I understand. So I don't see this as a viable solution.

### The Constant Need to Explain Motivations
**Recent Main offenders:**
* Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World
* My Hero: Academia
* Every Single goddamned Anime-themed Videogame I've every played (i.e. Tales of Berseria)
* Too many others to mention
    
This problem is not necessarily unique to anime, but for some reason, I've found that it hits anime the hardest. 

How many times have you heard some variation of the following phrase uttered by either a main character or secondary character in an anime:

* "I've finally figured out that my life path is..."
* "...and that is what I believe!"
* "...and this is why I fight! And I'll never stop until I...

The list could go on. It really could. Anime characters seem to never stop chirping about their life path, about how they don't have one, or about how they've discovered one, or about how they'll never waver from it. **It just never stops**.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="" :src="'/berseria.jpg'" />
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">A fun game, especially with a friend, but Tales of Berseria is terrible at this: every character constantly spells out what they're motivated by.</span>
</div>

But that's just anime, right? Hahaha, good old anime! So quirky, but we love you anyway!

Actually, this critique is indicative of a major problem in the way that anime tells its stories, in that it commits one of the *deadly sins of storytelling*: **show, don't tell**. 

I could write an entirely seperate post on the narrative benefits of showing, rather than telling, but the short summary is:
* **Showing** allows the viewer to build a mental model of the character in their head. It makes the character more believable, and increases immersion.
* **Telling** requires the viewer to suspend their disbelief. The viewer simply has to accept the words that the character is saying at face value (i.e. "my life path is..")

Mainstream anime is absolutely awful at this. My Hero Academia is particularly awful at this. Re: Zero is awful at this. Naruto is awful at this. Lots of anime is awful at this. 

When you tell, and don't show, characters ring hollow. There's no weight behind their proclamations of duty, or their lifelong passions. You just kinda have to nod your head and accept it. And when this happens, your suspension of disbelief snaps: the characters act as if they're reading from a script, rather than as real, thinking human beings, with goals, motivations, and personal opinions. 

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="" :src="'/script.jpg'" />
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">My mental image of the the main characters from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Want_to_Eat_Your_Pancreas">"I Want To Eat Your Pancreas"</a>. An absolutely awful anime that constantly explains its characters' motivations every 5 seconds, including a vomit-inducing 5-minute monologue at the film's conclusion</span>
</div>

But there's a reason why anime studios *tell* instead of *show*, and I don't think it's because anime writers are simpletons that can't grasp this basic rule: **it's easier and cheaper to tell, rather than show**. Why bother animating an episode *showing* why a main character has difficulty trusting others? Instead, you can just dedicate 90 seconds to a flashback scene of still-frames, and have the character *tell* the audience why they have trust issues while sad music plays in the background. How emotional! Now, the character's trust issues make sense!

Showing is obviously harder to do: it requires more time and more skill: you need to make it clear to the viewers what you're trying to communicate without being obnoxiously overt about it. And more importantly, the consequences getting it wrong are dire: if viewers happen to miss what you're trying to show, they might react to major character plot points with statements like, "that seemed out-of-character for her", or "wow, I wouldn't have expected him to do that". 

Therefore, studios would rather not spend the time or money in *showing* a character's motivations, especially when there's a possibility for screwing it up and leaving the viewers confused. They'd rather opt for the easy route and simply explain, quickly and easily, why a character does the things that they do. As a result, the narrative and its characters suffer.

This is unfortunate because, when done well, "showing" instead of "telling" makes for amazing, interesting, and most importantly, believable characters.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="limitedMedium" :src="'/spike.jpg'" />
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Spike from Cowboy Bebop tells us that he's "just a simple bounty hunter", but the anime shows us that that's far from true. He's complex, troubled, and most importantly, human.</span>
</div>

So it's incredibly frustrating to see the anime industry constantly missing the mark when it comes to this crucial, fundamental rule of storytelling. 

Therefore, if an anime's characters are constantly telling you how they feel and what they're motivations are, instead of actually showing you through their behaviors, then I'd avoid it. It's characters are likely going to be bland, one-note, script-reading drones.

**Remediation: Anime needs to have more faith in its viewers.** Its audience is growing up. If a show is marketed towards children, then explain everything and anything you need to. But for all other types of shows, give your audience and your narrative the respect it deserves. Take the time to write characters that we can believe in, instead of taking the easy way out by having them blurt out "This is my path!" every 5 seconds.

### Inability to Commit to Major Narrative Decisions 
**Recent Main offenders:**
* None mentioned for spoiler reasons

There's nothing worse than watching an anime, witnessing a *major, story-altering event go down*, and then tuning into the next epsisode only to find that *most of the anime's narrative dynamics haven't changed*.

Let me explain through an example: I sat down to watch an anime movie with my fiance, in which the movie ties in with an existing, currently-airing anime. At the climax of the movie, the main character sacrifices their powers to save the world, and I thought to myself, "man, that is ballsy. That is going to have huge ramifications on the anime." I don't watch the anime in question, but I was legitimately intrigued at this creative decision. 

But, to my disappointment, at the very end of the movie, he gets his powers back, and the rest of his crew forgets everything that happens, tying a neat little isolating bow around the events of the movie, ensuring that anime remains undisturbed by the dramatic events of the movie. And then I heaved a heavy sigh, and my negative perception of this anime was re-affirmed.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="" :src="'/dn.jpg'" />
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Remember when Death Note had the confidence to pull off killing L, a beloved main character? And then cowardly backtracked on that decision by replacing L with two inferior L's?</span>
