title: How to Buy a Display For Gaming
summary: "With the PS5/Xbox Series X coming out soon, you might be thinking about buying a new TV or monitor. Unfortunately, display companies make the decision-making process as confusing as possible (likely on purpose). After having to wade through the misinformation myself, I figured that I'd help others to avoid having to go through the same painful process I did."

## No Time, Give Me The Quick Version
- **If you needed to look up a guide, your current TV likely can't support 4K/120FPS content**
- If you need a big boi, buy a TV. If you need a little boi, buy a monitor
- You probably don't need HDMI 2.1 unless you want to be on the bleeding edge of tech
- An **IPS** monitor is usually ideal, unless you need super fast response times (then use TN)
- Use <a href="https://www.rtings.com/">RTings</a> to find a TV/Monitor in your price range with acceptable latency/response times

## Disclaimers
Before I delve into this opinionated overview, I have to get this out of the way: the difference between 60 frames-per-second (FPS) and 120 FPS may not be noticeable to you, nor will the jump in resolution from 1080p to 4K (*especially when most games aren't rendered in true 4K anyway, *). That's perfectly fine! But if you're the kind of person that *does* notice those kinds of things, or you just enjoy getting your technical hands dirty, then read on.

This guide will be divded into several sections, where each section will go over some concepts or choices that you'll have to make, depending on your tastes, requirements, or budget. Before I get into things, a huge shout out to <a href="https://blurbusters.com/">Blur Busters</a> and <a href="https://www.rtings.com/">RTings</a>. I've sourced some of their images in this article, and in general, I've used their articles for my own edification and when buying my own gear. They're both fantastic sources of info.

## Essential concepts
Before delving into what to buy, it's helpful to know how to make meaningful comparisons between displays (other than "this monitor has gamerz lights all over it, so it must be good"). The main features of a display are covered in the subsections below:

### Response Time
This marketing point is probably the most-used by gamer monitor companies, but is probably one of the most misunderstood metrics. It does **not** measure how fast the monitor responds to your mouse/controller inputs (despite what the name suggests). Instead, it measures how fast a pixel changes colors. **This affects how blurry an object appears as it moves across your screen**, which is important for action-oriented games. See the image below, which is taken <a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/tests/motion/motion-blur-and-response-time">RTings's excellent article on response time:</a>

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="" :src="'/response_time.PNG'" />
</div>

The object in motion is blurrier on the left because of the monitor's worse response time (33.3ms) than the monitor on the right (6.8ms). This metric is usually pretty easy to find in the advertising for a TV or monitor.

### Input Latency
*This* is the time is takes for the display to respond to your mouse/controller (technically, your monitor does not respond to inputs. It's the amount of time from when the display receives the image to when it actually shows the image on screen). This is obviously most important in action-oriented games, but frankly, a display with poor input latency feels awful with just about any game: it even makes navigating through menus an absolute chore. 

For some reason, display companies do all that they can to hide this information from consumers: they never release input latency metrics, and to make matters more confusing, latencies have very weak correlations to price: occasionally, very expensive displays will have extremely high latencies, while very cheap ones will be virtually lagless. For this, you'll have to rely on independent sources. Fortunately, <a href="https://www.rtings.com/monitor/tests/inputs/input-lag">RTings publishes their input lag test results</a>, so you can check the input lag of the display you're interested in before your purchase. They are independently funded, so support them if you have the means to do so.

### Refresh Rate (or "framerate")
This is the maximum amount of frames-per-second that the display supports. Like "Response Time" above, this also affects the blurriness of objects in motion. Think of frame rate like the number of pages in a flipbook (see below if you don't know what those are).

<div class="imageContainer small">
  <img class="small" :src="'/flip_book.gif'" />
  <span class="titleImageCaption">This is a flipbook, <a href="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/units/4/learning_activities/la_1">taken from here</a></span>
</div>

The higher the refresh rate, the more pages in the flipbook, and therefore, the smoother the animation. The lower the refresh rate, the less pages in the flipbook, and therefore, the choppier the animation. The refresh rate of a display functions on the same principal: animations will be smoother when the refresh rate of a monitor will be higher

## TV or Monitor?
The first major decision you'll need to make is whether you want a TV or monitor. Historically, TVs are usually cheaper since they're more of a commodity, but at the highend (i.e. 4K 120hz) they're equally, absurdly expensive ($1000+). Regardless, I think the most important factor is your use case:
- Do you need something big to sit in a living room? Or will it go on a table/desk? 
- Do you strictly play console games? Or do you play PC games?
- Do you own a laptop? Or do you own a desktop PC and find use in a standalone monitor?

### I Need a TV
If you need a TV, then you simply need a TV that supports an HDMI version high enough to support your needs. The higher the HDMI version, the more expensive the TV will likely be. See the table below for how the HDMI versions correspond to resolution and framerate:
<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;

.tg .tg-u0o7{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;text-decoration:underline;vertical-align:top}
.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
</style>
<table class="tg">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-u0o7">HDMI Version</th>
    <th class="tg-u0o7">Max Resolution</th>
    <th class="tg-u0o7">Max Framerate @ 4K</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">1.4</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">4K</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">30</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">2</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">4k</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">60</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">2.1</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">10k</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">120</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Note that if your content is NOT at max resolution, then you MAY be able to get away with exceeding the max framerate. For example, if your TV is only 1080p and supports HDMI 1.4, then you'll likely be able to play 60FPS content. 

### I Need a Monitor
If you need a monitor, you'll need to take note of the HDMI specification chart above and make sure that the version your monitor supports meets your needs. You'll also main need to decide on the type of "display technology" you want. Briefly, they're described below:
- **IPS**: has the best viewing angles and colors. Slower response times than TN panels, and usually more expensive
- **TN**: Fastest response times but colors change the most when viewed at an angle. Usually the cheapest
- **VA**: Somewhere in between IPS and TN. In my opinion, I wouldn't recommend these for anyone.

Note that if you have a somewhat high budget, you can "brute-force" your way to an IPS display that has fast response times and good input latency, so I'd recommend an IPS panel if your budget allows for it.

## Putting It All Together
Armed with the knowledge that I've imparted to you, below you'll find my recommendation on what kind of display to purchase based on what your needs are:

**If you know for a fact that you'll be consuming 4K/120FPS content**, purchase a TV with HDMI2.1, or purchase a monitor that supports that resolution and refresh rate. Prices will be all over the place, TV or monitor, but they'll all be over $1000. PS5 and Xbox Series X *claim* that they'll support this kind of content, but I really don't see this happening (see the final section of this article, "One Final Caveat"). If you game on PC, though, I can see a need for this kind of display.

**if you're fine with either 4K/60FPS or 1080P/120hz content**, make sure you have a TV with at least HDMI 1.4 support. This should be MOST TVs made within the past 5 years. If you have a 4K TV right now, then you likely don't need to purchase one. If buying a monitor, ensure that it meets these specs. **This would be the most cost-effective choice for new PS5 / Xbox Series X owners**. 

## Gotchas
1. **Input latencies lowest when at native resolution and refresh rate**. If you intend to use a display at it's non-native settings (i.e. a Nintendo Switch on a 4K TV) expect input latencies higher than what's reported. For example, I bought a $600 monitor that has an input latency reported at 8ms, but jumps to **33.ms** when the content is 60hz. This was never advertised and never made clear to me. I only got confirmation when RTings reviewed the monitor I had bought (otherwise, I never would have purchased the monitor!)

2. **Take notes of the manufacturer's warranty policy.** Buying a TV is pretty easy, as you can usually go to a physical store and buy one. And as such, returning one is also pretty easy, as retail stores usually take returns for any reason without asking questions. But when buying a gaming monitor, you may have to resort to buying one online from different, eclectic sources. Therefore, when things go wrong (dead pixel, dead on arrival, etc), you may be stuck talking directly to the manufacturer. Certain companies (Dell, ASUS, etc) consider monitors with 1-3 stuck pixels "acceptable", which is absolutely criminal in my opinion, so make sure you know what you're getting into, and what your rights are as a consumer if you choose to buy a monitor.

3. **Be wary of TV's that claim 120FPS.** There are some TVs out there that CLAIM to support 120FPS content, but don't actually do so. They get around this by performing something called "motion interpolation", which is an algorithm that takes in 60FPS and, using math and machine learning, inserts new frames into the content based on the differences between each frame. While this is admittedly cool piece of technology, motion interpolation is flawed because the frame it generates is an approximation (it's generated based on a guess, not real information), and more importantly, *the entire process takes time to compute**. Therefore, it adds a TON of input latency. So to ensure that your TV actually supports 120hz content, check for HDMI 2.1 support.


## One Final Caveat: What's the Point?
I need to make one final point before you all go out and by the newest LG ABCD696969 4K3D 120HZ TV. Recall that, during the previous generation (i.e. Xbox One and PS4), we were promised 4K/60FPS, and we never got anywhere NEAR that (aside from indie titles, or titles tha are intentionally less-graphically demanding). 

When the Xbox One X and PS4 Pro came out, both companies were like, "OK No, for real this time, we gonna do 4K/60FPS", both consoles STILL didn't live up to that claim: they often faked it using techniques like dynamic resolution (i.e. "**up to** 4K") or [checkerboard rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkerboard_rendering) (I love it when games use dynamic resolution, don't get me wrong. I think it's just dishonest when companies aren't upfront about using it). Hell, the PS4 Pro barely even reached 1080p/60FPS for many popular titles (See God of War, [which needs to run at 1080p to reach 60FPS](https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/12/17227946/god-of-war-ps4-pro-60fps-4k-1080p)). 

I understand that character models and textures keep increasing in complexity, which eats into the resolution and graphics budget. And I also understand that there is marketing pressure to increase image fidelity over image fluidity (it's hard to convey 120FPS over static screenshots) but regardless, overpromising and underdelivering is not a new trend in this space. I vaguely recall being promised 1080p/60FPS as far back as the 360/PS3 generation, so it's slightly hilarious, and a little frustrating, that both Microsoft and Sony are promising 4K/120HZ when they haven't even been able to deliver anything remotely NEAR that this generation.

In short, keep your expectations low. Expect for games to render **up to** 4K/120hz, but for the majority of them to render far below that, for the majority of the time (save for a few first-party, big-budget titles). **Purchase your next display based on the fact that most games that you'll be playing will not be natively rendering at 4K/120FPS\***.<span class="disclaimer">*unless you game on PC and own a 3080/3090</span>
