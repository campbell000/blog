title: How to Buy a TV or Monitor For Gaming
summary: "With the PS5/Xbox Series X coming out soon, you might be thinking about buying a new TV or monitor. Unfortunately, display companies make the decision-making process as confusing as possible (likely on purpose). To combat the intentional misinformation, here's a guide that (should) make things a little clearer."

## No Time, Give Me The Quick Version
- **If you aren't sure, then your current TV likely can't support 4K/120FPS content**
- If you have a 4K TV made within the past 3 years, then you're probably fine for 4K/60FPS.
- If you need a large display, buy a TV.
- If you play competitive shooters, fighters, or platformers, buy a monitor (lower input lag)
- Use <a href="https://www.rtings.com/">RTings</a> to find a TV/Monitor in your price range with acceptable latency/response times
- Console games will likely not be rendered in true 4K/120hz, so keep your [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) in check.

## Disclaimers
Firstly, the difference between 60 frames-per-second (FPS) and 120 FPS may not be noticeable to you, nor will the jump in resolution from 1080p to 4K (*especially when most games aren't rendered in true 4K anyway, *). That's perfectly fine! But if you're the kind of person that *does* notice those kinds of things, or you just enjoy getting your technical hands dirty, then read on.

Secondly, I want to shout out <a href="https://blurbusters.com/">Blur Busters</a> and <a href="https://www.rtings.com/">RTings</a>. I've sourced some of their images in this article, and in general, I've used their articles for my own edification and when buying my own gear.

## Essential concepts
Before making any decision about what to purchase, it's important to understand the basic concepts of display technology so that you can make meaningul comparisons between displays on your own. The main concepts are covered in the subsections below:

### Resolution
Resolution refers to how many pixels are on the screen, often abbrevated to acronyms like "1080p", "4K", etc. Increasing the number of pixels on the screen allows you to discern more detail in any given image. See the chart below illustrating the difference in pixel count between the various resolution categories:

  <img class="" :src="'/resolution.png'" />

</div>

### Refresh Rate (or "framerate")
The refresh rate of a display is the maximum amount of frames-per-second that the display supports, often expressed as "60hz", "120hz", etc. This affects the blurriness of objects in motion. Think of frame rate like the number of pages in a flipbook (see below if you don't know what those are).

<div class="imageContainer small">
  <img class="small" :src="'/flip_book.gif'" />
  <span class="titleImageCaption">This is a flipbook, <a href="https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/units/4/learning_activities/la_1">taken from here</a></span>
</div>

When there are more pages in a flip book for a given animation, the animation will be smoother. When there are *less* pages, then the animation will be choppier. The refresh rate of a display functions on the same principal: animations will be smoother when the refresh rate of a monitor is higher, and vice versa.

Note that buying a high refresh-rate display will have little benefit if your games have low framerates. For example, if you only play Xbox One / PS4 games, it makes little sense to buy a 120hz monitor, since both consoles can only output at 60hz.

### Response Time
This marketing point is probably the most-talked-about, yet least-understood. It does **not** measure how fast the monitor responds to your mouse/controller inputs (despite what the name suggests). Instead, it measures how fast a pixel changes colors. **This affects how blurry an object appears as it moves across your screen**, which is important for action-oriented games. See the image below, which is taken from <a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/tests/motion/motion-blur-and-response-time">RTings's excellent article on response time:</a>

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="" :src="'/response_time.PNG'" />
</div>

The object in motion is blurrier on the left because of the monitor's worse response time (33.3ms) than the monitor on the right (6.8ms). This metric is usually pretty easy to find in the advertising for a TV or monitor.

### Input Latency
*This* is the time is takes for the display to respond to your mouse/controller\*. This is obviously most important in action-oriented games, but frankly, a display with poor input latency feels awful with just about any game: it even makes navigating through menus an absolute chore. <span class="disclaimer">\*technically, the latency is the time from when the display receives the image to when it shows the image, manifesting as controller lag</span>

Unfortunately, information about a display's input latency is difficult to find. Companies do everything they can to hide this information from consumers, and to make matters more confusing, latencies have very weak correlations to price: sometimes, very expensive displays will have high latencies, while very cheap ones will be virtually lagless. Therefore, you'll have to rely on independent sources for this information. Fortunately, <a href="https://www.rtings.com/monitor/tests/inputs/input-lag">RTings publishes their input lag test results</a>, so you can check the input lag of the display you're interested in before you buy it.

### HDMI Versions
One final thing you'll need to understand (especially for console gamers) is HDMI support. In order to achieve 4K/120hz, your TV or monitor will need to support HDMI 2.1 (as well as the display actually having 4K pixels and having a refresh rate of 120hz or higher). See the chart below on how the HDMI versions correlate to resolution and framerate:

<style type="text/css">

<br/>
The implication of this chart is that, if your TV or monitor is 4K, but only supports HDMI 1.4, then that means that you WONT be able to achieve 4K/60FPS. So double check the highest supported HDMI version before buying something, especially if you plan on purchasing the display for a console.

## TV or Monitor?
The first major decision you'll need to make is whether you want a TV or monitor. Historically, TVs are usually cheaper since they're more of a commodity, but at the high-end (i.e. 4K 120hz) TVs and monitors are equally, absurdly expensive ($1000+). Regardless, I think the most important factor is your use case:
- Do you need something big to sit in a living room? Or will it go on a table/desk? 
- Do you strictly play console games? Or do you play PC games?
- Do you own a laptop? Or do you own a desktop PC and find use in a standalone monitor?

The one major advantage of a monitor, however, is that monitors usually have much better input latencies than TVs. Your average monitor will have latencies somewhere between 8ms and 30ms, while your average consumer TV (i.e. from Best Buy and the like) may have latencies anywhere between 30ms and 50ms (and that's with "Game Mode" on. Usually, out of the box, *it's worse*).

### I Need a Monitor
If you need a monitor, then you'll need to take note of the HDMI specification chart above, and you'll also need to decide on the type of "display technology" you want. Briefly, they're described below:
- **IPS**: has the best viewing angles and colors. Slower response times than TN panels, and usually more expensive
- **TN**: Fastest response times but colors change the most when viewed at an angle. Usually the cheapest
- **VA**: Somewhere in between IPS and TN. In my opinion, I wouldn't recommend these for anyone.

Note that if you have a somewhat high budget, you can "brute-force" your way to an IPS display that has fast response times and good input latency, so I'd recommend an IPS panel if your budget allows for it. The best way to decide between these three is to simply go to a computer store and check out examples.

## My Recommendations
Armed with the knowledge that I've imparted to you, below you'll find my recommendations on what kind of display to purchase based on what your needs are:

**If you know for a fact that you'll be consuming 4K/120FPS content:** purchase a monitor or TV with HDMI 2.1. Prices will be all over the place, TV or monitor, but they'll all be over $1000. PS5 and Xbox Series X *claim* that they'll support this kind of content, but I really don't see this happening, outside of a few games early on the console's lifespan (as a "woweee look at what this new console can do!" kind of feature).

**If you're fine with either 4K/60FPS or 1080p/120hz content:** make sure you have a TV with at least HDMI 1.4 support. This should be MOST TVs made within the past 3-4 years. If you have a 4K TV right now, then you likely don't need to purchase one. If buying a monitor, ensure that it meets these specs, with good response times and input latencies that your budget allows for. *This would be the most cost-effective choice for new PS5 / Xbox Series X owners*. 

**If input latency (i.e. controller lag) is a major concern:** buy a high refresh-rate monitor. If you play a lot of competitive shooters, fighting games, or platformers (games that require quick, precise, reflex-based movements), I would highly recommend playing these games on a monitor: as stated above, monitors usually have much lower input latency than a TV (at the cost of image quality).

## Gotchas
1. **Input latencies are lowest when at native resolution and refresh rate**. If you intend to use a display at non-native settings (i.e. a Nintendo Switch on a 4K TV) expect higher input latency. For example, I bought a 1440p monitor that has an input latency reported at 8ms, but jumps to **33ms** when the content is 1080p. This was never advertised and never made clear to me. I only got confirmation when RTings tested the monitor and published their test results (otherwise, I never would have purchased the monitor!)

2. **Take notes of the manufacturer's warranty policy.** Buying a TV is pretty easy: you can usually go to a physical store, pick one out, and return it if something goes amiss. But when buying a gaming monitor, you may have to resort to buying one online. Therefore, when things go wrong (dead pixel, dead on arrival, etc), you may be stuck talking directly to the manufacturer. Certain companies (MSI, ASUS, Razer) are an absolute pain to deal with, and some have asinine warranty policies (i.e. ASUS believes that selling a monitor with 4 dead pixels is "acceptable", while I happen to think it's "illegal"). Therefore, make sure you know what you're getting into, and what your rights are as a consumer.

3. **Be wary of TV's that claim 120FPS.** There are some TVs out there that CLAIM to support 120FPS content, but don't actually do so. They get around this by performing something called "motion interpolation", which is an algorithm that takes in 60FPS and, using math and machine learning, inserts new frames into the content based on the differences between each frame (you may know this feature by it's other name: the "soap opera effect"). While this is admittedly cool piece of technology, motion interpolation is flawed because the frame it generates is an approximation (it's generated based on a guess, not real information), and more importantly, **the entire process takes time to compute**. Therefore, it adds a TON of input latency. So to ensure that your TV actually supports 120hz content, check for HDMI 2.1 support.

## A Counterpoint: Will We Actually Get 4K/120FPS Games?

  <img class="medium" :src="'/craig-the-brute.png'" />
    <span class="titleImageCaption">They promised 4K/120FPS, and we got....this</span>
</div>

I need to make one final point before you all go out and by the newest LG ABCD696969 4K3D 120HZ TV. Recall that, during the previous generation (i.e. Xbox One and PS4), we were promised 4K/60FPS, and we never got anywhere NEAR that (aside from indie titles, or titles that are intentionally less-graphically demanding). 

Then, when the Xbox One X and PS4 Pro came out, both companies were like, "OK No, for real this time, we gonna do 4K/60FPS", and yet both consoles STILL didn't live up to that claim: they often faked it using techniques like dynamic resolution (i.e. "**up to** 4K") or [checkerboard rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkerboard_rendering). Hell, the PS4 Pro barely even reached 1080p/60FPS for many popular titles (See God of War, [which needs to run at 1080p to reach 60FPS](https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/12/17227946/god-of-war-ps4-pro-60fps-4k-1080p)). <span class="disclaimer">

I understand that character models and textures keep increasing in complexity, which eats into the resolution and graphics budget. And I also understand that there's marketing pressure to increase image fidelity over image fluidity (it's hard to convey 120FPS via static screenshots), but regardless, overpromising and underdelivering is not a new trend in this space. I vaguely recall being promised 1080p/60FPS as far back as the 360/PS3 generation, so it's slightly hilarious, and a little frustrating, that both Microsoft and Sony are promising 4K/120FPS when they haven't been able to deliver anything NEAR that this generation.

In short, keep your expectations low. Expect games to be rendered **up to** 4K/120hz, but for the majority of them to render far below that, for the majority of the time (save for a few first-party, big-budget titles). **Purchase your next display based on the fact that most games that you'll be playing will not be natively rendering at 4K/120FPS\***.<span class="disclaimer">*unless you game on PC and own a 3080/3090</span>
