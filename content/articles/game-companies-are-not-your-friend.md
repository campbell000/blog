title: Game Companies are Not Your Friend
summary: "Stop pre-ordering games. Stop giving game companies personalities (i.e. \"good guy CDPR\", \"good guy Nintendo\"). Stop trusting them. They will exploit and decieve their customers as much as the applicable laws allow."

## Disclaimers
- Do not direct any hatred at the rank-and-file workers of any of these companies. I'm sure the regular developers at CD Projekt Red, and at game companies in general, put their heart and soul into their games. I'm sure that, if it were up to them, Cyberpunk 2077 wouldn't not have been released until it was good and ready (i.e. not on Dec 10, 2020)
- With that said, buying these games because "you should feel sorry for them and support the industry" is simply perpetuating the problem and enabling parasitic CEOs to continue exploiting passionate developers.

## The Context
Ostenisbly, this post is about Cyberpunk 2077. Because if you haven't heard, the game's entire development history has been an absolute mess, and the way that CD Projekt Red, the game's developer, has handled it has been an absolute disgrace and an insult to fans of the game and gamers everywhere.

To my knowledge (I'm not a "gamerz journo" so I don't have the inside scoop), this is roughly what happened with this game and why it's launch has been such a travesty, and a lesson to developers everywhere in how *not* to handle AAA game development:

- With an inflated ego from the success of The Witcher 3, beloved developer CD Projekt Red brags on multiple occasions that their hip game dev studio [doesn't have crunch](https://kotaku.com/cd-projekt-red-boss-again-promises-that-cyberpunk-devs-1835518344), which is a cutesy name for the cruel practice of forcing mandatory, grueling overtime on their employees. It's common in the gaming industry.
- The game, being in development for [9 years](https://www.gfinityesports.com/article/8658/cyberpunk-2077-how-long-has-it-been-in-development-9-years), was set to release in August 2020, but then delayed to September, then to November. Going back on their word, [the studio mandates "crunch time"](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/09/30/cyberpunk-2077-devs-backtrack-on-no-mandatory-crunch-stance-report-claims/). The game is delayed *again*, this time to December.
- Game review outlets aren't allowed to use their own footage when writing reviews, and only PC copies of the game are sent to reviewers, despite the fact that [41% of the game's were for consoles](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/cyberpunk-2077-refund.html), a metric the studio was surely aware of since pre-order statistics were likely similar
- Many, many mainstream game review publications (IGN, gamespot) don't do *nearly* enough to bring this up, and shower the game with 9's and 10's.
- [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/), ever complicit in the vicious cycle of game industry/advertising corruption, lists Cyberpunk 2077 as having a 91 out of 100 in the Xbox and PS4 sections, which is blatant deception (they may have updated it, but it WAS 91 at one point).
- Unsurprisingly, the game is in an [absolutely unacceptable state](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review-ps4-xbox-one-price-size-gameplay-2338569) on PS4 and Xbox One, despite those consoles being the initial primary targets for development. Surprisingly, the game also runs pretty terribly on PS4 Pro and Xbox One X, as well.
- CD Projekt Red [apologizes](https://www.pcmag.com/news/cd-projekt-red-offers-apology-and-refunds-for-cyberpunk-2077) "for not showing you the game on base last-gen consoles". In other words, they're sorry for intentionally deceiving 41% of their customers, and getting blasted on the internet for it.
- In a move that should be illegal, but for some reason isn't, Microsoft and Sony are [refusing refunds](https://www.t3.com/us/news/cyberpunk-2077-ps4-and-xbox-players-fuming-as-sony-and-microsoft-refuse-refunds_) for the game, telling players to wait for patches. Patches that no one even knows what they'll contain or what they'll address.

I think that covers most of it. If you can't tell, I don't quite buy the sincerity of their apology, nor do I think that their mistakes can be boiled down to "aww shucks, guys, we really messed up! Can you ever forgive us?" 

Rather, I think that every single step was cold, calculating, and extractive, vying to exploit their exmployees and consumers as much as possible without caring whether or not their employees were well taken care of, or whether they could put out a product that they could confidently stand behind.

## The Problem
As I said above, at the surface, this post is about Cyberpunk 2077, but when you think about the gaming industry, and about consumerism in general, the long bullet-point list above *is really nothing new*. Remember how badly we all hated EA? Or Ubisoft? Or Activision? Or Blizzard? Or at a more general level, remember when Comcast was the most hated company in America, so much so that they had to change their brand to "Xfinity" to escape the negative association with the name?

So, let's start with a question: how did we get to this point?

Looking back at that bullet-point list, the signs were obvious that Cyberpunk 2077 was going have a tumultuous launch, to say the least: being in development for 9 years, going back on their word about crunch time, the numerous delays, not giving out console versions of the game to reviewers. 

But through a variety of means, perhaps primarily owing to its humble beginnings as a small polish studio, CD Projekt Red managed to cement itself in the minds of gamers as a "good guy" among the faceless, soulless EAs, Blizzards, and Ubisofts of the industry. And, to be fair to CD Projekt Red, that very well may have been true at one point. I have not personally played the Witcher 3, but I *do* know second-hand that it has enjoyed a plethora of content updates, and has been continuously supported by the devs for many years, which is in stark contrast to many mainstream titles where the devs simply go dark after a few years until the playerbase dwindles into nothing.

But whoever is calling the shots over at CDPR must have noticed the company's positive image, and saw it as an excellent opportunity for exploitation, because almost every single public-facing action (I can't speak for what happens behind closed doors) concerning Cyberpunk 2077 has been actively consumer-hostile.

This should be a wake up call to gamers, young and old, experienced or inexperienced: no matter how it may seem: game companies are not your friends.

## Game Companies are Not Your Friends
CD Projekt Red, despite being the most topical example of betraying their friendly, hip, "good guy" image, is definitely not the first company to get caught with their pants down and holding a gun to their consumers heads.

As an avid Nintendo fanboy, it really pains me to say this, but despite what you might think, Nintendo is *also* not your friend. Despite their kid-friendly appearance and their ["Fun First"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdxEUL18ySY) attitude, Nintendo is extremely legally-aggressive. For example, Nintendo [shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21579392/nintendo-big-house-super-smash-bros-melee-tournament-slippi-cease-desist) a Super Smash Brother Melee Tournament because it featured a mod that allowed people to play online, whereas the original game didn't have online play. There are ethical issues about piracy involved, sure, but c'mon: COVID-19 makes it *literally impossible for fans of this game to meet up and play*, and it's impossible to buy unless you purchase it second-hand (of which Nintendo receives no cut).

If Nintendo were a "good guy" company, would it *kill* them to throw their extremely dedicated Smash Bros Melee community a bone and simply *look the other way* in light of a global pandemic making it impossible to enjoy the game?

Or how about another company that recently experienced a major fall from grace, Valve? In the early 2000's, valve garnered a ton of good guy points for releasing great games (half life, team fortress, portal, etc), and also having a nerdy, frank, personable face of the company (Gabe Newell). You'd see "Good Guy Gabe" memes crop up every now and again, and most gamers had a healthy amount of respect for the company.

But as Steam gained a stranglehold on the PC game distribution market, many saw Valve as unfairly [exploiting that position](https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/16/15622366/valve-gabe-newell-sales-origin-destructive). If you don't recall, Valve was *extremely* late to the game at implementing refunds, only doing so because they were legally required. They also ban your account if you issue a credit card charge back, meaning you lose all of your games in the process if you ever have a dispute with them that you feel doesn't get fairly resolved in your favor. There's also the simple fact that valve takes a whopping 30% of revenue made for every game sold, a percentage that, in 2020, is under increasing scrutiny for being extraordinarily high.

The list could go on. Practically every major, hated game company (Activision, Blizzard, EA, etc) started small. And I'm sure that at one point, they had the perceived image of a young, scrappy, honest company. But for most of these companies, those days are long gone. And for *all* companies (at least, ones that are publicly traded, or have shareholders that aren't employees), it's inevitable that those days will end.

**Because when companies grow, they'll be forced to make decisions that will make shareholders, beancounters, and middlemen happy, but at the cost of the overall health of the company**.

When companies are small, the employees that *actually care about the long-term health of the company* are actively involved in the day-to-day tasks. They oversee many operations, big to small, and there's a passion, drive, and agility to get things done.

When companies are *large*, however, things simply *slow down*. You need to hire people to do things not only to produce your product, but also to simply maintain your company. You need a 100-person legal department. You need an army of accountants. You need a team of advertisers. You need to solicit funding from total strangers that don't know the first thing about your company. Hell, you need to hire people to *hire people*. You need to hire people to manage finances. You need to hire people to advertise. 

When these kinds of people start to outnumber the people that actually know and care about the core mission of your company, that's when you get your EAs. That's when you get your Ubisoft's, your Activision's. And now, that's when you get your CD Projekt Red's.

This is why Cyberpunk 2077 released in December even though it clearly wasn't ready: they needed to ensure that the shareholder and accountant quarterly numbers (or whatever the hell) were healthy, and they needed returns **now**. Plus, they needed to hit that lucrative holiday shopping season, quality be damned.

This is why Nintendo banned the Big House Melee Tournament. Nintendo's legal department and their middlemen simply don't understand the nuances of emulation, modding, and the passion of the smash bros esports scene, and how these things could actually stand to *benefit* their company and their brand. Frankly, these people don't give a shit about any of that, and can't be bothered to understand it. They just want to make sure that their Nintendos aren't pirated.

This is why Valve doesn't release games anymore, aside from games that have unlimited microtransactions (aside from Half-life Alyx) or can be heavily monetized: the beancounters simply decided that traditional games don't make financial sense, and it's better design games that chase microtransaction whales, despite the fact that many game studios seem to be doing just fine.
## The Solution
