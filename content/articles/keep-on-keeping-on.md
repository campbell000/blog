## Disclaimers
1. With each post on this blog, I'm trying to improve my writing. One major goal of mine is to improve my focus and to make my writing more concise. Therefore, this post, and possibly more posts in the future, will be shorter and to-the-point as the topic permits.

## Context
For those that don't know me, I've been grappling with many different health issues over the years. Some are clearly defined, but are incurable unless I go through major surgery, which many doctors have recommended against since it could do more harm than good. While the pain and physical limitations keep me from doing some of the things that I love, I've mostly come to terms with the fact that I'll never be "normal" in this respect. As a guy who had previously prided himself on his physical fitness, my ego has been permanently bruised, but I've had no choice but to press on and do what I can (i.e. go jogging, lift light weights, etc).

Some of my other health issues, however, are much more pernicious and ill-defined: I've been bounced around from doctor to doctor, unable to get a diagnosis for something that clearly affects me on a variety of levels: I fatigue easily, I lose focus easily, I have major sleeping issues (which compounds the first two issues), I have various neurological issues (tingling in hands/feet, nerve pain, headaches, etc, etc, etc). In short, for the past 5 years or so, it has not been a fun ride.

The closest thing to a diagnosis I've gotten is "a [Chiari Malformation Type I](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chiari-malformation/symptoms-causes/syc-20354010)" after getting an MRI of my head performed, but many doctors claim that the condition is symptomless, and the "cure" is brain surgery, which may cause even more complications. So obviously, that's not something I'm itching to try any time soon.

To be fair to the medical profession, I don't envy doctors that have patients coming in saying that their heads hurt. That could literally be one of a hundred different afflictions. But at the same time, to be frank, I've met a *lot* of shitty, dismissive doctors: out of the 9 or 10 doctors that I've seen, I've found 1 or 2 that have actually **listened** to me, rather than waited for me to be done talking so that they could tell me what they've already decided before I've finished speaking. I'm not sure where the fault lies (overworked doctors? overbooked schedules?), but this is a common complaint with the medical profession: many doctors simply *don't listen*, or aren't willing to think outside of the box.

But the point of this post isn't for me to complain the failings of the medical field, or for me to "WAAAAHHH" about my life. The paragraphs above are to simply provide context for this post (and to also namedrop "Chiari Malformation". If anyone reading this either has tips on how to manage it, recommendations on specialists to see, anecdotes about surgery, or anything else, please contact me. Check my "About" page).

## Life Sucks And There's Nothing You Can Do.
That's quite a statement, right? And I don't
