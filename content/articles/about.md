## Why This Site was Created
Before delving into why I wanted to start dedicating time to a blog, I wanted to share with you a separate-but-related issue that I care deeply about. 

### A Story About the Music Industry
My brother, who's in the music scene, told me that [cassette tapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_tape) are sort-of back in style. Arguments about music fidelity aside, I can definitely see the appeal: compared to music streaming services like Spotify, you actually own the music.

Additionally, the artist will actually make a couple bucks off of your purchase, as opposed to the fraction of the penny they'll make from Spotify. And, as opposed to buying music digitally, cassette tapes can function as tiny pieces of artwork you can display around your living space. I don't see the industry shifting back to physical media any time soon, but I can certainly see the niche appeal.

I'm not delusional enough to think that this sudden, drop-in-the-bucket interest in physical media will make one iota of a difference to Spotify's bottom line, but I *do* hope that it represents a slow shift in how consumers think about their music-consuming habits, and how it affects their favorite artists. 

Because, if you don't know this already, the shift towards music aggregation services like Spotify has *totally screwed* all but the biggest artists. And even then, it's not really the artists that benefit: [*their record labels take most of the money*](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=video&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwio77-1947tAhXjqFkKHZVhD3cQtwIwBHoECAMQAg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D2Ad1sNtqQ5Y&usg=AOvVaw1w0dpaKGqfibJJGlB_JXYh). Across the board, as more and more people stream their music instead of purchase their music directly from the artist, things get worse for musicians. This is because:
1. **There's more middlemen in the music industry than ever before:** social media and streaming service managers are now vital for success
2. **Exposure is controlled by a handful of companies:** if you aren't on Spotify, you don't exist.
3. **These companies pick and choose which artists succeed:** They leverage that via pitiful compensation to artists.
4. **Music aggregation services have too much content:** most people only listen to what these companies recommend to them, which are usually the super profitable, big name, big brand artists. Little names are difficult to find (if they are on the platform at all)

These four points creates a negative feedback loop: the less money that these small musicians make, the less time they can dedicate to making music. The less time they can dedicate to making music, then the less chance they have in standing with the big players, making them less money. So in the streaming service model, where only the big names stand out, small musicians have no chance.

Your response to all of this this might be, "I work 8 hours a day and I hate my job, so I think musicians should get a real job and quit whining." And, that's a fair point. Not everyone is going to love their job. 

**But, wouldn't that be nice?** Wouldn't it be nice if it were possible for people to put their passion and talent into something, and at least be able to buy groceries without also having to work at Burger King? Wouldn't it be nice if you could quit the job that you hated to pursue something that you loved doing? Wouldn't it be cool if this was at least possible, albeit unlikely?

Personally, I think this would be a wonderful thing. How do we make this happen? Well, we could take some small, but meaningful steps, like going to our favorite artists' local shows. Maybe we could tell our friends about their music and share it online? And, of course, we could buy a cassette tape or two.

### A Blog is Kind of Like a Cassette Tape
How does this relate to starting a blog in 2020? In the past few years, much like how people consume much of their music through music aggregation platforms like Spotify and Youtube Music, many people consume news and information through news aggregation platforms like facebook, google, twitter, and reddit. Unless a piece of news is a front-page headline with billions of upvotes and thousands of little gold stars plastered all over it, your average person (myself included) probably won't see it. 

In a way, a blog is kind of like a cassette tape: both are mediums for content with very limited appeal in today's technological landscape. Most people would rather get their content served to them as a curated (or rather, algorithm-selected) list, rather than do the work of discovering content on their own.

**But that sucks**. Much like how music aggregation services harm artists, content aggregation services harm content creators: no one benefits except for the big, dominant voices at the top, who are the only ones with enough money to employ tactics like:
<ul>
  <li>
   <b>Paying the content aggregators for exposure on the service itself</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
      Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc, allow people to pay to get their content seen by a wider group of people
      </li>
      <li>
      Reddit <b>claims</b> that they don't accept payments for content to appear on the front page, but...c'mon.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    <li>
    <b>Paying for Advertising</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
      Advertising sucks, but it works. Small content creators can't afford to spend money on advertising, but the big brands can spend millions on it
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
      It's criminally easy to pay a few hundred people to post reviews about your content, acting as real, unbiased customers, and have it appear like the general population is genuinely interested in your product. It's been proven that when you think other people like something, you'll be inclined to like it, too (i.e. "Groupthink"). <b>Companies exploit sites like reddit and twitter using this technique all the time</b>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

These advantages, plus many more, mean that only groups and organizations with deep enough pockets and influence have any real visibility online.

Additionally, when the point of online discourse becomes not to discuss, but to sell products and propagate opinions, this has the adverse effect of dumbing down online discourse for everyone. Take a look below at a screenshot I took of Reddit's "Top Post" as of 2020-11-19 12:49PM. It's literally just an advertisement for a pizza chain:

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/ad.PNG'" />
    <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">I blocked out the actual company so you wouldn't have to be subjected to the actual advertisement.</a></span>
</div>

Does anyone think that this advertisement for pizza reached it's top spot organically? Do we really think 34,000 people saw this and thought to themselves that this post was so compelling, that they thought to upvote it over all other pictures they saw that day?

For someone like me, this is pretty sad: in real life, I'm a pretty closed off individual. Introverted, you could say. But like most other human beings on the planet, I want to engage in discourse. I want to discuss, debate, listen, and learn. For people like me, the internet used to be a great place to do that. But unfortunately, I'm beginning to feel less and less comfortable doing so on platforms such as Facebook and Reddit that are designed to stamp out litte, independent voices like my own.

On top of that, these platforms are ultimately data-collection/advertising-platforms first, and content-platforms second, which is *creepy as hell*.

Therefore, instead of posting something to reddit, twitter, or facebook, and giving these big tech companies free content to monetize and sell to advertisers, I've starting selling my own cassette tapes of tech content. Nothing on this site is monetized. Nothing is tracking you, and I'm not here to sell anything. I don't accept sponsered blog posts, and I won't write about something if you pay me. The only thing you'll see on this site is a donation link at the bottom, which will go to domain costs (and maybe some toys for my dog) and simply gives people a way to let me know that they support my content.

To wrap this up: I'm staring a blog to become a part of the change I want to see: a shift back to the internet of yesterday, where smaller voices could actually reach people. Where content could simply exist on the internet without a monetary purpose, without a desire to collect your data, where content doesn't simply exist for advertisers to analyze and aggregate into a dystopian, consumerist black hole.

## How This Site Was Created
This site was created with Nuxt.js, generated statically (using their "content" module) using nuxt-generate and hosted on GitHub pages. Miraculously, I managed to do it using the following tech stack:
- Macbook running Bootcamp, running...
- Windows with Windows Subsystem For Linux (WSL2) installed, running...
- Ubuntu installed

I ran into a few problems with this setup (a few bootcamp-related issues, and then a few WSL2-related issues), but miraculously, this all seemed to work out. I'll write a tutorial later with a more in-depth explanation later, but I followed [this guide as the foundation](https://nuxtjs.org/blog/creating-blog-with-nuxt-content/). It'll be a shame when Apple takes away Bootcamp (when Apple giveth, they take away twice as much), but for now, I love the flexibility that their Intel-based Macs offer. RIP Intel.

As for my feelings about Nuxt.js: it's *very* opinionated, meaning that it values convention over configuration, which I'm not a huge fan of. I like my code explicit and verbose, rather than implicit and magical. And like all other modern web development stacks, when things don't work, *they fail spectacularly*. Obtuse error messages that read like an ancient foreign language, stack traces a million lines long, etc. That may not really a fault of Nuxt.js, but rather its underlying technologies (webpack, babel, etc), but it still makes Nuxt.js a little unpleasent to debug.

But when things work, *damn, do they work*. Nuxt.js got this blog up and running *very* quickly. In particular, its static site generation and content modules are *amazing* and, most importantly, allowed me to host this site for free (aside from domain costs). And because it's statically generated, **it's fast as hell to load and use**. So overall, my opinion of Nuxt.js is positive, and I'm curious to see how it evolves over time.
