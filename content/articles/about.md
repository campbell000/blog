## About Me
I'm a professional software developer with a variety of interests. I'm a jack-of-all trades, master-of-none. I don't have any specialties, but I'm stubborn as hell.

The coolest programming project [I've ever completed on my own is linked here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLwrLrBcj8). It started as a failed Master's Degree project, but managed to find success over the course of several re-writes (and a shiny new $400 GPU).

## Why "Never Meant"?
Why not? Sometimes, things are [Never Meant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NfnXdXpjL0) to be.

## What Kind of Content Should I Expect on This Blog?
Lots of different things! Below are some examples:
- General Technology Posts and How-Tos
- Programming Tutorials
- Short Essays and Opinions
- Video game / Anime / Music Reviews and Analyses

I'm the only contributor to this blog, but I wouldn't be opposed to guest contributions!

## How should I contact you if I have comments, questions, or concerns?
Each article has it's own comments section, but if you want to contact me directly, you can email me directly at: <a href="mailto:contactme@nevermeant.dev">contactme@nevermeant.dev</a>

## How Frequently Will This Site be Updated?
~~Probably about once a week.~~ When I think that I have something interesting to say.

## Why Does this Blog Exist?
It exists because I simply enjoy writing about things that interest me. But the answer obviously doesn't end there. If it did, then why wouldn't I simply post to Facebook, or Reddit, or one of the other big information/content aggregation platforms?

When I first started writing this "About" page, I began by indiscriminately dumping my pent-up frustrations about how **coporate, soulless, and lame** the mainstream internet has become. I soon realized that I had *a lot* more to say on the subject than I realized, so I moved it <NuxtLink to="/why-start-a-blog-in-2020">to its own separate post.</NuxtLink> 

If you don't want to read that post, then the short version is that these big content aggregation companies like reddit, facebook and twitter wield too much power over the internet: they're designed to stamp out smaller voices like my own, and amplify the large, big brand voices (like corporations, businesses, politicians, etc). These large, powerful voices taking control over the internet has a net negative effect on its utility and creativity. 

Therefore, by starting a blog (and maybe inspiring others to do the same), I hope to decentralize some of that power, which will hopefully make the internet a better, more-accessible place for average people like myself.

## What Kind of Privacy Concerns Should I Have While Using Your Site?
I've taken great care to ensure that this site is as minimally invasive as possible. There are no ads or trackers, and no social media integration of any kind. I use google fonts and occasionally embed youtube links, but that's about it.

## Is This Site Monetized in Any Way?
No. There are no ads, referral links, analytics trackers, or anything else that might surreptitiously generate revenue for me without you, the user, knowing about it. I don't take bribes to write about products, people or concepts.

The only thing you'll see on this site is a donation link at the top of each article, where you can make a one time or continuous donation, which will go to site costs (and maybe some toys for my dog). It also simply gives people a way to let me know that they support my content. 

## How Was This Site Created?
This site was created with Nuxt.js, generated statically (using their "content" module) using nuxt-generate and hosted on GitHub pages. Vuetify (which I woulnd't recommend, in retrospect) is used as the client-side style framework.
