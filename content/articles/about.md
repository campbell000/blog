## Why This Site was Created
I think the best way to describe the genesis of this site is to briefly explain a picture that I had recently taken of myself. It was one of the first times that I had actually taken a good, hard, critical look at myself (something that I generally avoid doing). And while I had intended for my analsysis to be physical, my thoughts drifted towards a lot more than that. Behold: 

<div class="imageContainer">
<img class="small" :src="'/self.png'"/>
</div>

Looking at it now, I can't help but think how utterly *ridiculous* this picture looks to me:
- A Super Mario Shirt (which is secretly a Splatoon shirt for those of you that are especially attuned to Nintendo games)? 
- Shin-High Pizza Socks? 
- In a gym, lifting weights? 
- As a software developer?

After studying myself for a bit, I found this image to be a pretty good representation of one of the core personality issues that I struggle with: "Who am I supposed to be? What archetype am I supposed to fit into? What am I supposed to be really good at?" **I'm obviously not the only software devloping, videogame playing, pizza-loving, gym-loving, young white guy out there**, but that provides little solace to someone like me who doesn't truly excel at *any* of these endeavors, and doesn't feel like they squarely fit into *any* of these social circles. 

To elaborate, I would like to think I'm an *OK-to-pretty-good* programmer. I'm *pretty good* at the video game I play competitively. I *have an ear* for music, but am a medicore musician and composer. I try to stay in shape, but poor form in my early years has been an albatross around my neck, and I pay the price with pain and limited gains. But despite me spending lots of time on these things (programming in my free time, tons and tons of music lessons in middle school and highschool, videogame tournaments two times a week, exercise daily, etc), I had never seemed to crack the code to *truly* excel. Time passed, I began to work full time, and I slowly began to loosen my grip on my aspirations of achieving greatness. I guess that's what happens when you get older?

But this isn't a post for me to whine and complain. I've been blessed with many, many things. And statistically, *very* few people achieve greatness. But that's not to say that I have no great qualities: if there's one thing that I'm *really* good at, it's that I try *really* hard. I'm peristant. I'm stubborn. And most importantly, I'm *really good* and being *pretty good* at *a lot of things*. There's a lot of things in my past that I used to consider "failed attempts", but now that I think about it, they can easily be considered "learning oppurtunities", even if [I never was the very best, like no one ever was.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg6CiPI6h2g). So, as a result, I have ton novice-to-intermediate-level skills in my head. And I'd like to think that this gives me an upper-hand in the ability to teach and impart knowledge, since *I am very familiar with having to learn, and then re-learn and re-train, over and over again* to truly grasp skills and concepts. 

Therefore, while it's taken me 20-some years of soul-searching for me to get to this point, I think I've finally figured out a way to put my "jack-of-all-trades" talent to good use: I intend to use this blog to document technical problems and concepts in a way that average people like me can understand them. And maybe sprinkle some other fun posts in along the way.

And one other thing: there's a certain kind of retro, nostalgic charm in creating a blog in 2020. It kind of feels like "sticking it to the man" in a way, rather than simply handing content over to reddit/twitter/facebook/etc for free. These big tech companies are so, so ravenous for content, so it feels kind of nice to truly own something (I know, this is being hosted on GitHub, which is owned by Microsoft. That last statement wasn't entirely accurate)

## How This Site Was Created
This site was created with Nuxt.js. I'll write a tutorial later with a more in-depth explanation later, but I followed [this guide as the foundation](https://nuxtjs.org/blog/creating-blog-with-nuxt-content/). Nuxt.js is *very* opinionated, which I didn't like, but it got this blog up and running *very* quickly, and static site generation is *amazing* and, most importantly, **free**.
