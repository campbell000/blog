## Disclaimers
* I will keep plot-specific details to a minimum, but beware: this post may contain some minor, early spoilers for Xenoblade Chronicles 3, and some vague spoilers for Xenoblade Chronicles 2.
* I completed the game on the "Hard" difficulty, and also completed most of its side quests. This took me about 120 hours.
* I am a *huge* fan of Xenoblade Chronicles 1 and 2 (despite how flawed the latter turned out to be). This has likely influenced my opinions and expectations for this third game.

## Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Punctuates Nintendo's Venerated Series
Almost 5 years after the relase of Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 (henceforth referred to as "XC3") is finally here. While not quite a finale for the entire Xenoblade Chronicles Series, a director for the series [was quoted as saying](https://nintendoeverything.com/monolith-soft-shares-xenoblade-chronicles-3-message-another-tease-of-the-future/) that this game can be considered the end of the story that started with <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'The events of Xenoblade 1 and 2 were kicked off by Klaus, a power-hungry scientist that activated a poorly-understood technological artifact that ended up splitting the universe in two.'">Klaus' experiment.</text-with-tooltip> In other words, "a stopping point". A resting place. A period in which the team and the fans can gather their thoughts, reflect on past experiences, and ponder where the series will go next. Xenoblade is not gone, but it's likely to go away for a while.

So, as the ~conclusion~ "stopping point" for the beloved series, how does Xenoblade Chronicles 3 fare? 

Interestingly, my opinion of this game eerily mirrors its premise: in Xenoblade Chronicles 3, two conflicting universes collide, leading to unstable paradoxes and conflict. Likewise, this game is full of ideas and concepts that both simultaneously enhance and detract from the overall experience. It's paradoxical, but not always in a good way.

Let me show you what I mean.

## The Graphics
<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/xc3vista.gif'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Xenoblade Chronicles 3 occasionally makes you forgot that you're playing a game on an 5-year old mobile processor. This game's technical and artistic aspects are, at times, expcetional.</span>
</div>

### A Stunning Technical Achievement
It goes without saying that <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'While it\'s difficult to determine their exact contribution, Monolithsoft had a significant hand in Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I theorize that they were tapped for their expertise in open-world games, showcased excellently in Xenoblade Chronicles on the Wii.'">Monolithsoft's work on Nintendo's consoles is unparalleled</text-with-tooltip> (perhaps only secondary to Nintendo). In terms of performance, scope, complexity, and content, the Xenoblade Chronicles series has always been a cut above anything else: the environments in Xenoblade Chronicles 1 were unlike anything else on the platform, and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 offered Nintendo Switch fans a glimpse into what Nintendo's new console was capable of.

So, naturally, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 sees Monolithsoft upping the ante in just about every regard: both artistically and technically, this game is an amazing sight to behold. The landscapes are vast, the character models are more expressive and detailed, the lighting is vastly improved (Xenoblade 2 had a plastic-looking quality to it), and there is a dramatic increase in the number of characters and enemies that can be onscreen at any given time. More impressive is the fact that, despite all of these improvements, I noticed very little <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Pop-in and LOD culling involves either removing objects on screen, or using a lower-detailed version of that object, when the object is far from the player\'s view. With both approaches, the idea is that the player won\'t notice, thereby conserving computing power and memory for objects that the player can actually see.'">pop-in and LOD culling.</text-with-tooltip>

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xcneon.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">In an interesting artistic choice, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 makes sparing, but calculated, use of neon colors to make environments pop when they need to.</span>
</div>

All of these improvements aren't simply for the pixel-counters and the framerate snobs. Instead, through Monolithsoft's impressive attention to detail, they help the world of Aionios feel like a *real, living universe*. This is evident simply by stopping and looking around: dozens of enemies wander the world, sometimes fighting amongst each other or scavenging for food. Waterfalls, mountains, and cliffs dot the horizon. The sun emits a ray of orange as its reflected across a seemingly-infinite sea. None of this would be possible without squeezing every last piece of performance out of the Switch. 

In short, unlike other open-world games that feel more like "zones" or game-developer-crafted playgrounds (cough: Pokemon, Sonic Frontiers), Xenoblade Chronicles 3's technical feats aren't merely for show: they've allowed the designers at Monolithsoft to craft a world that is believable, while still being something that players will want to explore.

### But Also Overly Ambitious
<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/xcblurry.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">When things get hectic, image quality gets <i>very blurry</i>, evident in this offical screen capture from Nintendo. Worse, the game can sometimes slow to a crawl.</span>
</div>

Unfortunately, despite my previous fawning over XC3's technical achievements, it seems as though Monolithsoft pushed the humble Nintendo Switch a little *too* hard. Like most Switch games, [XC3 employs a technique called "dynamic resolution"](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-xenoblade-chronicles-3-nintendo-switch-tech-review) to push the resolution (i.e. image quality) as high as it can go during static scenes, while dropping it to lower levels when things get hectic in order to maintain a stable framerate. The idea behind this technique is that players will be less likely to notice a blurrier image when there's a lot going on.

This sounds great in theory, but in practice, this framerate/resolution trdaeoff is neither appealing or effective. Instead, Xenoblade 3 seems to buckle under the weight of its own ambitions: image quality is rarely crisp, and gets even *worse* during battles. I'm not typically a resolution snob, but the fuzzy image quality makes it difficult to make sense out of all of the lines, circles, and effects during batle. I'm not lying when I say that it would typically take me a few seconds to orient myself at the beginning of a battle to figure out what I'm up against, or the number of enemies in battle. I can't help but wonder if an increase in image quality would make battles more legible.

Despite the hit to image quality, dynamic resolution doesn't seem to be enough to keep the framerate stable. Simply walking around some of the more-desnely populated areas incurs a notable stutter, and in battles things can get even worse: framerates can frequently dip to what felt like 15-20 frames per second. Worse still, XC3 actually *slows down* when the framerate drops, making it more difficult to get the timing right on certain attacks.

One final note: it seems like the Switch could not handle rendering some of the cutscenes in real-time: some of the cutscenes are rendered on the fly, while others are obviously movies. Normally, this wouldn't be noticable, but for some odd reason, Monolithsoft elected to 
<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xcblur.png'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Note the color banding and blocky artifacts of the white light. I can confirm that this is <i>actually</i> how this cutscene looks in ame, and is not from Youtube compression (ironically, it LOOKS like a badly-compressed Youtube video)</span>
</div>



The art direction in Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is also strong and, thankfully, mostly consistent. Perhaps in response to its predecessor being criticized as <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'This term implies that anime is inherently childish and silly, which is objectively untrue. Yes, anime meant for teens can be silly and obnoxious, but anime also exists for many other, more mature demographics.'">"too anime"</text-with-tooltip>, Xenoblade 3 art and character designs are a little more down to earth. Gone are the [ridiculous outfits](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/xenoblade/images/f/f1/RexOfficialArt.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=2017111002005), [immersion-breaking anime graphics effects](https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/5/57366/3342789-anime.jpg), and the [outrageously dressed](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/xenoblade/images/f/f1/RexOfficialArt.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20171110020057) and [unbelivably proportioned](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/xenoblade/images/9/91/XC2-Rex-and-Pyra.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20171029080031) female characters (well, most of the characters, anyway). In short, characters look a little more like real people, and this is arguably a good thing.

This is especially notable given this game's predecessor, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, which was criticized for being too "anime-esque". Even though <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'It implies that anime is inherently childish and silly, which is objectively untrue. Yes, anime meant for children and teens can be silly and obnoxious, but anime exists for many demographics.'">I take issue with the term "anime-esque",</text-with-tooltip> I understand and mostly agree with the sentiment: despite Xenoblade 2's attempts to establish a complex narrative, spanning multiple games and universes, these attempts are undermined by its proclivity for [fanservice](https://gintendo-namer.squarespace.com/articles/2018/2/5/xenoblade-the-sjw-article), [penis jokes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMBRC1dHALY), [accidental boob touchubg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc-u936MOB4), and other kinds of generic anime silliness. This is made worse by a terrible North American localization: many of the game's attempted jokes and humor fall flat due to the actors' stilted delivery and the game's unnatural-sounding script.

In short, you won't find anything quite like Xenoblade Chronicles 3 on the Switch.
































































































Xenoblade Chronicles 3 wastes no time in immediately establishing its main conflict: warring nations, Agnus and Keves, have been locked into what seems to be a neverending war. The opening cutscene has Noah, the main character, narrate over scenes of death and devestation; we literally see the life get drained out of fallen soldiers as their rivals chant and cheer on the battlefield. <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Well, as grusome as it can possibly be for a T-rated game.'">It's a grusome sight</text-with-tooltip>.

We're also told that, in this twisted world, people only have 10 years to live. But it's unlikely that they'll live that long: all of Aionios' inhabitants are ordered to train and fight to the death, which literally fuels their survival: killing the other faction replenishes the home faction's "Flame Clock". If that goes out, all humans in that faction will perish.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 wastes no time in getting you, the player, invested into this strange fantasy world and its bizarre and unforgiving rules. Why must the nations fight? Why do corpses need to be "sent on" by Mio and Noah, each nation's respective "Offseer"? Who created this system of violence that revolves around war and Flame Clocks, and what purpose does it serve? It's all very grim, and the game excels in making players wonder *what it all means*.

While it would take far too long to describe all of the ways in which Xenoblade Chronicles 3 dedicates itself to its world and its mature tone, here are some notable highlights:

* Throughout your time with Xenoblade 3, you'll find literal rotting corpses that the game encourages you to "send off", meaning that Noah and/or Mio need to play the flute to allow their souls ascend. While their plaintive melodies float through the air, corpses' ashes drift away. It's almost as if the game is forcing you to take a moment of silence for the departed, both in-game and in real life.
* Character backstories grapple with mature themes like depression, despair, loss, and hopelessness. Sena, in particular, has one that particularly hits home: her need for acceptance is so strong that she finds herself adopting personas and attitudes just to please others, which makes her lose sight of who she really is.
* There's a distinct lack of attempted humor: there's very little punchlines, no visual gags, and practically no slapstick humor. Characters tend to joke and rib amongst themselves, but this feels more like world building and character development, rather than a juvenile wink and nudge toward the player. 

This is in <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Both Xenoblade Chronicles 1 and 2 take several hours to offer the player any sort of incentive or narrative hook. Players are forced to complete dull tutorials and uneventful fetch quests before they can get to the good stuff. Xenoblade 1 is particularly slow to start.'">direct contrast to most other JRGPS (including previous Xenoblade games)</text-with-tooltip>, which typically force players to meander around farm villages or idyllic, quaint cities before digging into anything interesting or important. Instead, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 appropriately sets the tone from the very start, and is surprisingly consistent throughout the 60+ hours it takes to complete the main story. While the game *does*  occasionally offer respites from the doom-and-gloom with some levity and silliness, it doesn't let these moments completely overshadow the fact that *inhabitants of Aionios must fight to live, and live to fight, which leads to immeasurable death and destruction*.

  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">It's been fun (winkey face)...to learn about Xenoblade Chronicles 3's world and characters.</span>
</div>

In short, through it's consistency, resistance to silly anime cliches, and attention to detail, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is refreshingly serious about its world and characters.

This is especially notable given this game's predecessor, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, which was criticized for being too "anime-esque". Even though <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'It implies that anime is inherently childish and silly, which is objectively untrue. Yes, anime meant for children and teens can be silly and obnoxious, but anime exists for many demographics.'">I take issue with the term "anime-esque",</text-with-tooltip> I understand and mostly agree with the sentiment: despite Xenoblade 2's attempts to establish a complex narrative, spanning multiple games and universes, these attempts are undermined by its proclivity for [fanservice](https://gintendo-namer.squarespace.com/articles/2018/2/5/xenoblade-the-sjw-article), [penis jokes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMBRC1dHALY), [accidental boob touchubg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc-u936MOB4), and other kinds of generic anime silliness. This is made worse by a terrible North American localization: many of the game's attempted jokes and humor fall flat due to the actors' stilted delivery and the game's unnatural-sounding script.

I'm not here to blame and shame people for enjoying sexiness and silliness, but for a series like Xenoblade Chronicles, scenes like this create a tonal dissonance that makes me, the player, take things less seriously. Is this an epic sci-fi novel, or smut?

Xenoblade Chronicles 3, thankfully, swings the pendulum back towards Xenoblade 1's tone (and maybe even further): while the game still gives off that uniquely-japanese levity at times, it never dimishes or distracts the player's investment into its world.

**This is important** because much of your enjoyment of this game will depend upon how invested you are in the game's world. There are a *lot* of cutscenes in this game, so it's vital for players to actually *want* to learn more about and resolve the game's main conflict. Thankfully, in my opinion, this game will likely succeed in getting most players invested into the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 universe. *I* certainly was, at least.

<info-box :quotes="false">
As an aside, there's a cutscene around the 40 hour mark that is (in my opinion) the best, most heart-wrenching cutscene in the entire Xenoblade series. The motion-captured choreorgraphy, the music, the voice acting, the script; for about 20 minutes, Monolithsoft's efforts perfectly align to create a powerful and genuinely affecting moment that trascends its medium. The cutscene is a <b>massive</b> spoiler, but for those that want to know what I'm talking about, or don't mind spoilers, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XO9tmU3GVNs">here it is.</a>

### Combat: Complex, yet Rewarding
<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/xc3battle.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">I'm sure this screenshot looks bewildering to those unfamiliar with Xenoblade. There's lots to learn about XC3's battle system, but in my opinion, it's worth learning.</span>
</div>

As I mentioned above, much of this game is made up of cutscenes. You'll spend about half of your playtime watching, listening, and reading. This is a *good* thing, since I'd argue that the game's world is interesting and complex.

But the other half of your playtime will likely be spent either preparing for battles, or actually battling. Let me explain.

This game's battle system is deep and complex. Perhaps maybe a little *too* complex. It builds off of Xenoblade 1 and 2's systems, so I can't speak to how intimiding and confusing it might be for a new player. In addition, the game constantly introduces new wrinkles into the battle system, up until about half way through the game. So in addition to the its initial complexity, the battle system only gets *more* complicated as time goes on.

But I'd argue that this actually *helps* the player come to grips with the wonderful flexibility that the game has to offer. Things start <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Well, relative to how complicated the battle system gets by the end of the game.'">relatively simple</text-with-tooltip>: the game teaches you how to auto-attack, how to use Artes (special moves that deal more damage), and basic mechanics such as swapping characters, teaching you how classes work, how to equip accessories to increase stats, etc.

Then, one by one as you progress, the game introduces more mechanics: <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'abilities that you can learn from and borrow from other classes'">Master Artes and Master Skills</text-with-tooltip>, <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Performing two Artes at the same time, combining their effects'">Fusion Artes</text-with-tooltip>, <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Super-powered forms characters can assume for a limited time'">Oroborous Forms</text-with-tooltip>, and <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Stops time and allows players to attack enemies repeatedly'">Chain Attacks</text-with-tooltip>. I'll admit that the game's constant use of made-up anime RPG jargon got overwhelming at times.

But given the motivation and time to learn the ins-and-outs of the game's mechanics, something awesome happens around the 20-hour mark: confusion, complexity, and ambiguity give way for flexibility, freedom, and power. Want to turn Eunie, one of the game's default healers, into a critical-hit landing powerhouse? How about a tank that is frail but impossible to hit? Or maybe you'd rather put her in a support role that has insane synergies with one of your other attackers?

In Xenoblade Chronicles 3, not only is this possible, but it's actively *encouraged*. By constantly changing classes for all 6 of the playable characters, something that the nudges you to do when you've maxed out the current class, you allow them to learn skills and abilities from other classes. Put simply, it's *fun* to see how one character (say, a healer) might benefit from donning a different hat (say, an attacker's). Maybe they'll learn some neat buffs, or maybe they'll acquire skills that make them able to contribute to *actually dealing damage*.

One other notable feature is what the game calls "fusion artes". This mechanic allows players to perform two artes at once, and when doing so, any secondary effects of these artes are combined and amplified. 

For example, say you have an <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Area-Of-Effect. In other words, the attack hits all enemies in an area'">AOE</text-with-tooltip> arte, and an art that puts people to sleep. If you combine these two artes, the result would put *all enemies in the surrounding area to sleep*. 

The possibilities that Xenoblade Chronicles 3 offers for mixing and matching your Artes to create insanely wacky and powerful combos are endless. An arte that both <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'RPG-speak for an attack that ignores any damage reduction incurred from an enemy\'s defenses'">pierces</text-with-tooltip> and crits? An Arte that can buff your team and debuff an enemy at the same time? An Arte that heals *twice*? All of this and more is possible.

And as one final note, the game doesn't *force* playes to constantly deal with this complexity. When switching classes, the game helpfully sets some sensible defaults for artes, accessories, etc. So if you want total control of your team's composition, have at it! But if you'd rather not sweat the small stuff and just enjoy the ride, the game lets you do that, as well.

In short, I'd argue to not let naysayers discourage anyone from diving into Xenoblade 3 (or 2, for that matter). Yes, the mechanics of this game are confusing, and the constant tutorials can be a little annoying ([famously memed on by Dunkey in his Xenoblade 2 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiVZMxf4E2Q)), but I'd argue that there's nothing quite like spending 20 minutes crafting the perfect set of classes and abilities, and then *beating the absolute shit* out of a previously-troublesome boss.

## Miscellaneous Goodness






One final example that particularly sticks out is this game's "Hot Springs Scene". For those of you that aren't hip to anime culture: many anime and anime-inspired games contain one or more scenes that happen in a hot spring (or sometimes a pool or beach). In these scenes, characters typically have little or no clothes on, and usually involve scenarios that put the females in compromising or revealing situations. This can be something like the males trying to peek on the females, or <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'OK, seriously, do japanese women do this when they visit hot springs with their friends/peers? I can\'t say that I\'ve ever had the urge to do something like this in male locker rooms, and I don\'t know any women that have admitted anything remotely similar. Honestly, it sounds like something a male would wishfully fantasize about.'">the women feeling each other up and comparing breast sizes,</text-with-tooltip> or sometimes, the camera simply long pans up and down the womens' bodies. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 had a scene like this, and it was exactly as described, above.

In a ["leaning on the forth wall"](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall) kind of way, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 starts off with one of these "hot springs" cutscenes, but this time, the game plays things *completely* straight: as befitting for a hardened combat squad, this game's characters take a dip in a co-ed hot spring, completely naked. But there's no jokes, no scenes of male characters being creepy, and no long-panning over female bodies. The characters utilize the bath for healing purposes after a hard-fought battle, and begins and ends with little ceremony.

While this may seem like a silly, minor example, I think does a good job representing Monolithsoft's restraint this time around. <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Try panning the camera to face Eunie as she walks slowly. Also, stop asking why I know this.'">Yes, there is fanservice,</text-with-tooltip>  and yes, [there are characters in this game that have bizarre, distracting proportions](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/xenoblade/images/1/1a/XC3_Ethel_Twitter.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20221017035840), but in totality, the game has a distinct, cinematic feel when compared to other games in this genre, and I feel that it's all the better for it.

  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Xenoblade Chronicles 3 occassionally makes you forgot that you're playing a game on an 5-year old mobile processor. This game's technical and artistic aspects are, at times, expcetional.</span>

So, naturally, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 sees Monolithsoft upping the ante in just about every regard: environments are bigger, combat is more complex, sidequests are more plentiful, and narratively, the stakes are arguably as high as they've ever been.
