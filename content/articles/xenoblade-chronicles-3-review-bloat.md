## Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Punctuates Nintendo's Beloved Series
Almost 5 years after the release of *Xenoblade Chronicles 2*, *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* (henceforth referred to as "XC3", since the full name takes way too long to type!) is finally here. As the third game the Xenoblade Chronicles series, its director [was quoted as saying](https://nintendoeverything.com/monolith-soft-shares-xenoblade-chronicles-3-message-another-tease-of-the-future/) that this game can be considered the end of the story that started with <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'The events of Xenoblade 1 and 2 were kicked off by Klaus, a power-hungry scientist that activated a poorly-understood technological artifact that ended up splitting the universe in two.'">Klaus' experiment,</text-with-tooltip> but not the end of the *Xenoblade* series. In other words, "a stopping point". A resting place. A period in which the team and the fans can gather their thoughts, reflect on past experiences, and ponder where the series will go next. Xenoblade is not gone, but it's likely to go away for a while.

So, as ~the conclusion~ a "stopping point" for this beloved JRPG series, how does Monolith Soft latest entry in the *Xenoblade Chronicles* series fare? 

Given that XC3 takes a minimum of [62 hours to beat](https://howlongtobeat.com/game/103825), which doesn't include the 30-40 hours of additional content, there's no way that I'd be able to answer that question in a two-page essay. And since [game reviewers don't need to finish games anymore](https://twitter.com/raveofravendale/status/1496533451096440838?lang=en), I'd like to offer <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'No, I don\'t think game reviewers need to sacrifice their health to review games by a tight deadline. But there\'s an obvious difference between not finishing, say, Call of Duty, and a massive story-driven game like Xenoblade.'">my perspective </text-with-tooltip> as someone who has spent a *lot* of time with this game, as well both of it predecessors.

So, much like XC3 itself, I'm going to take *way too long* to explain to you what I think and how I feel. I suppose I could consider this long review as revenge for the time I spent/enjoyed/wasted on Xenoblde Chronicles 3. This game is certainly a ride, but it's not necessarily a fun one from start to finish.

Let's get started.

## Outstanding in Many Respects
It goes without saying that <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Monolith Soft was significantly involved in Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I theorize that they were tapped for their expertise in open-world games, showcased excellently in Xenoblade Chronicles on the Wii.'">Monolith Soft's work on Nintendo's consoles is unparalleled</text-with-tooltip>: the environments in Xenoblade Chronicles 1 pushed Nintendo's aging Wii console to its limits, and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 offered Nintendo Switch fans a glimpse into what Nintendo's new console was capable of, upping the ante from Xenoblade 1 in many respects.

It's no surprise, then, that XC3 continues that trend.

### A Stunning Technical Achievement
<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/xc3gif.JPG'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">Occasionally, XC3 makes you forgot that you're playing a game on an underpowered mobile processor from 2017. This game's technical and artistic aspects are, at times, exceptional.</span>
</div>

Both artistically and technically, this game is leaps and bounds ahead of anything else on the Switch. Simply compare the screenshot above to this screenshot of  <a target="_blank" href="/pokemon.jpg">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</a>. That comparison should speak for itself.

The landscapes are vast, the character models are detailed and expressive, <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Xenoblade Chronicles 2\'s lighting system gave characters an awful plastic-looking shine. Xenoblade 3\'s lighting system gives character models a much more realistic-looking glow.'">the lighting system is greatly improved</text-with-tooltip>, and there is a significant increase in the number of onscreen characters and enemies. More impressive is the fact that, despite all of these improvements, I noticed very little <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'LOD (level-of-detail) culling involves using a lower-detailed version of that object when the object is far from the player\'s view. The idea is that the player won\'t notice, thereby conserving computing power for objects that the player can actually see.'">pop-in and LOD culling</text-with-tooltip> that many games nowadays tend to use and abuse.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xcneon.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">In addition to the game's technical chops, XC3 makes intelligent use of neon colors to make environments pop.</span>
</div>

These improvements aren't simply for the pixel-counters and the framerate snobs, though. Instead, I'd argue that these improvements help XC3 feel like a *real, living universe*. Its biomes are teeming with personality and life, which helps evoke a nostalgic, childlike sense of adventure.

This is important because exploration is a large part of XC3's appeal: much of the player's time will be spent traversing the game's varied, ethereal landscapes. Despite a lack of any real secrets to discover or treasures to find (which I'll get to later), I'll admit that simply being able to observe the <a target="_blank" href="/xc3vista.gif">sun setting behind a vast expanse of distant mountains </a>for the first time was a real treat.

### A Mature, Consistent Narrative
<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/xcstory.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">XC3's dedication to its grim world and mature characters make the stakes feel real, rather than contrived.</span>
</div>

Let's talk about Xenoblade Chronicles 2, this game's predecessor, for a second. Xenoblade Chronicles 2's critical reception was divisive in many respects, but one common criticism was that the game was "too anime". Even though <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'It implies that anime is inherently childish and silly. Yes, anime meant for children and teens can be silly and obnoxious, but anime exists for many demographics. There are hundreds of anime shows that are thoughtful, mature, and nuanced.'">I take issue with this phrase,</text-with-tooltip> I mostly agree with the sentiment: despite Xenoblade 2's attempts to establish a complex narrative that spans multiple universes, its efforts are undermined by the game's proclivity for [fanservice](https://gintendo-namer.squarespace.com/articles/2018/2/5/xenoblade-the-sjw-article), [penis jokes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMBRC1dHALY), [accidental boob touching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc-u936MOB4), and [ridiculous-looking outfits](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/xenoblade/images/6/64/XC2_Pyra_artwork.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20171110014440). This is made worse by a shoddy North American localization and some <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Allegedly, the terrible performances are due to the voice actors and actresses being rushed, as well as being given little/no direction as to the appropriate tone for a scene. I can believe that.'">absolutely *terrible* voice acting performances</text-with-tooltip>, which ensures that any attempts at humor land with a thud.

I'm not here to shame people for enjoying sexiness and silliness, but for a series like Xenoblade Chronicles, scenes like this are incongruous with the seriousness of the game's conflict. Is this an epic sci-fi novel, or a harem-style romantic comedy?

XC3, thankfully, swings the pendulum back towards Xenoblade 1's more-mature tone (and maybe even further). Nintendo themselves have confirmed that this tone shift is intentional, as the game's developers had this to say about the character design process: 

<info-box :source-name="'Ask the Developer Vol. 6, XC3–Part 2'" :source-link="'https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-6-xenoblade-chronicles-3-part-2/'">
[S]ince the story is more serious than the previous titles, we designed the characters to look more mature by making them taller. We also designed the costumes to be not too flashy to match the tone of the story. [...] We asked Saito-san to tailor the overall design, including the clothing, to a dignified style that fits a serious story. 
</info-box>

In other words, "Saito-san, please give the characters clothes this time."

Look no further for proof of this darker tone than the game's opening cutscene: as battles between Agnus and Keves soldiers rage on, the player is forced to bear witness to the terrible consequences of war: rotting corpses and wounded soldiers litter the battlefield as soldiers celebrate a brief, temporary victory, only to be forced to fight again tomorrow. <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Well, as gruesome as it can possibly be for a T-rated game.'">It's a gruesome sight</text-with-tooltip>, reminding players that, in the world of Aionios, there are no winners. Instead, this pointless conflict ensures that everyone loses.

This war-torn, dystopian world has clearly taken its toll on the game's main cast, who are afflicted with bouts of anxiety, despair, and hopelessness. Despite its fantasy setting, XC3's characters endure struggles that may be all-too-familiar to the player (feelings of inadequacy, a fear of death, etc), making their struggles feel real and, perhaps, personal.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xc3sad.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">There are a few moments in Xenoblade Chronicles 3 that hit incredibly hard.</span>
</div>

In general, unlike Xenoblade Chronicles 2, this game never fails to remind the player that the stakes of XC3 are high: the world is inherently cruel, and innocent people are suffering.

That's not to say it's *all* doom and gloom, though. XC3 smartly breaks things up by sprinkling bits of levity throughout its narrative. But again, unlike Xenoblde Chronicles 2, these moments don't feel out of place in an epic sci-fi adventure. Instead, these moments lend humanity to the main cast of characters as they try to make light of a terrible existence. 

In that sense, it's refreshing to see Monolith Soft take its universe a little more seriously. And even though there are major problems with this game's narrative and its characters (I'll get to that below), I'd argue that XC3's more-mature tone is a step in the right direction.

### An Unwieldy, But Incredibly Rewarding, Battle System
<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/xc3battle.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">This screenshot will probably look bewildering to those unfamiliar with Xenoblade. There's lots to learn about XC3's battle system, but in my opinion, it's worth learning.</span>
</div>

I've dedicated most of this review so far to the game's environments and narrative. This is because most players will spend roughly half of their time exploring, watching, and listening. The other half will be spent in the game's battle system.

XC3's battle system is complicated. Perhaps maybe a little *too* complicated. It builds off of Xenoblade 1 and 2's systems, so I can't speak to how intimidating and confusing it might be for a new player, but I *can* say that it's one of the most complicated battle systems in any game that I've played. In addition, the game introduces new wrinkles and features into the battle system as the player progresses. It's likely that players won't find a comfortable groove until about 20 hours into the game.

At first, things are <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Well, relative to how complicated the battle system gets by the end of the game.'">relatively simple</text-with-tooltip>: the game teaches you how to auto-attack, how to use Arts (special moves that deal more damage), and other basic mechanics (swapping characters, equipping accessories, leveling up, etc). If you've played a JRPG before, the basics should click fairly quickly.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xc3sena.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">XC3's menus smartly hide much of the game's complexity in sub-menus, which gives players the option to either quickly scan the important stuff, or dive into the finer nuances of each characters abilities, stats, and equipment.</span>
</div>

Then, as players progress, the game introduces more mechanics: <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Abilities that you can learn from and borrow from other classes'">Master Arts and Master Skills</text-with-tooltip>, <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Performing two Arts at the same time, combining their effects'">Fusion Arts</text-with-tooltip>, <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Super-powered forms that characters can assume for a limited time'">Oroborous Forms</text-with-tooltip>, and <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Stops time and allows players to attack enemies repeatedly'">Chain Attacks</text-with-tooltip>. I'll admit that the game's constant use of made-up RPG jargon can get overwhelming, and despite the game offering an abundance of tutorials to ease players into these new mechanics, I'd often not fully grasp <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'It took me several hours to realize that the the Ouroboros forms were effectively “Oh Shit! Don\'t Die!” buttons. '">the point of a mechanic</text-with-tooltip> until several hours later. And yes, Xenoblade Chronicles 2's constant tutorials, [famously memed on by Dunkey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiVZMxf4E2Q), are back to relentlessly pester players.

But during my playthrough, after about 25 hours, something awesome happened: the mental burden of XC3's numerous mechanics began to ease, and I started to view these mechanics as tools instead of as sources of confusion. 

What do I mean by this? To give you some examples: want to turn Eunie, one of the game's default healers, into a critical-hit landing powerhouse? How about a tank that is frail but impossible to hit? Or maybe you'd rather put her in a support role that has insane synergies with one of your other attackers?

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xc3class.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">Changing classes is a great way to alleviate some of the tedium of using the same skills and abilities over and over. Plus, it allows characters to learn skills that they wouldn't otherwise be able to use.</span>
</div>

In XC3, not only is this possible, but it's actively *encouraged*. The game encourages players to constantly change characters' classes, and by doing so, they'll permanently learn skills and abilities from other classes. For example, if you change Lanz, the game's tank, to a healer class, they'll learn a healing skill that they can use *no matter what class you assign them*. 

XC3 explicitly tells players to change classes once a current class has reached its maximum level, and by doing so, most players will naturally realize how *fun and rewarding* it can be to experiment with the game's class system.

Another notable feature is what the game calls "Fusion Arts". This mechanic allows players to perform two arts at once, and when doing so, any secondary effects of these arts are combined and amplified. 

For example, consider two arts: one that is an <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Area-Of-Effect. In other words, the attack hits all enemies in an area'">AOE</text-with-tooltip> art, and the other is an art that puts enemies to sleep. By "fusing" these two arts together, the resulting art would put all enemies in the surrounding area to sleep. 

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xc3fusion.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">XC3's "Fusion Art" system opens the door for endless experimentation with each character's arts. While it can be a little overwhelming at first, it's incredibly satisfying to stumble on that perfect combination.</span>
</div>

The art fusions possibilities are endless. Want a fusion art that both <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'RPG-speak for an attack that ignores any damage reduction incurred from an enemy\'s defenses'">pierces</text-with-tooltip> and lands critical hits? Or how about a fusion art that can buff your team and debuff an enemy at the same time? What about a fusion art that heals *twice*? All of these combinations are fair game in XC3.

And on a final note, the game doesn't *force* players to deal with this complexity. When switching classes, the game helpfully sets some sensible defaults for arts, accessories, fusions, etc. In that sense, the game accommodates those that like to tinker and min-max their stats, but also those that don't want to sweat the small stuff and simply want to enjoy the ride.

In short, yes, the game's mechanics are initially bewildering. But I'd argue that there's nothing quite like spending a good 20 minutes finding the perfect combination of classes and Arts, and then *beating the absolute shit* out of a previously-troublesome boss. These moments can be exhilarating, and can vindicate any initial struggles a player may have with the game's battle system.

### Miscellaneous Goodness
While I want avoid making this review 100 pages, it wouldn't be fair for me to not mention the following:

- As expected, XC3's soundtrack is phenomenal. It's unlike anything else I've heard in a videogame. Its melodies are memorable and strong, but still manage to evoke the fantastical and the surreal.
- While not perfect (in particular, Mio's performance is pretty poor), the voice acting from the main cast is *much* improved over its predecessor, sounding downright impressive at times.
- Loading screens are kept to an absolute minimum, only occurring when you travel to another zone. For example, fast-traveling within a zone incurs almost no loading. Combined with a snappy menu, it's a joy to play a <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Many games, including this game\'s predecessor, contain laggy, unresponsive menus that making even the simplest management actions a chore to perform.'">game that can actually keep up with the player's inputs</text-with-tooltip>.
- In general, the game avoids a lot of the time-wasting nonsense that afflicts most other JRPGs, and contains many helpful quality-of-life features. This includes the auto-selling of items, the ability to immediately make changes and retry after a failed boss battle, and a generous navigation system that avoids a lot of the guesswork when trying to figure out where to go next.

## Disappointing in Many Respects
If you couldn't tell by now, there's a *lot* to love about XC3. But like the dual-natured world of Aionios, there is another side to XC3 that drags the entire experience down. While I don't want to belabor the issues that this game has, I'd like to justify my critiques thoroughly instead of blithely stating, "this game is bad. The characters are boring. The story is bad".

Allow me, then, to argue my points.

### A Conflicted Open-World Design
As a series that is renowned for its massively explorable environments, I want to first take a look at XC3's open world. At first glance, it definitely seems like lots of thought and care was put into its design: the terrain is varied, there are about a dozen different biomes, and there are plenty of callbacks to previous games in the series. 

Why, then, is the game so **unwilling** to let players explore it? For some reason, XC3 constantly thwarts any attempt at exploration with the following:
- Invisible walls blocking exploration until the current quest has been completed.
- Absurdly high-leveled enemies <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'I don\'t mind games using a passive approach to steer me in the right direction, but too often did my curiosity lead me to staring face to face with a level 80 Repentant Garzolg'">waiting to punish players with too much curiosity</text-with-tooltip>.
- Dead ends. Only later will the player learn that this area will be used as a set piece for a future quest.
- Hills, cliffs, and ropes that can only be traversed if the player has learned the requisite skill (i.e. the ability to climb vines). This is neither rewarding or fun; it instead feels like a ploy to waste the player's time by forcing them to constantly backtrack.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xc3climb.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">Found some cool vines to climb while exploring? If you don't have the climb ability, then too bad, you'll have to turn around.</span>
</div>

Does this sound like an open-world game to you? Of course not.

The player is forced to endure this mockery of an open-world until about <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'My memory is hazy, so this may be the wrong chapter. Regardless, this point is FAR into the game.'">chapter 5</text-with-tooltip>, which is when the game finally lets its guard down. There's no more invisible walls, all of the requisite climbing skills have been learned, and levels are likely high enough to take on most overworld enemies. So, the game is just a slow burn, right? Or as anime fans like to proclaim, "bro, just complete the first few chapters, and then it gets good"?

Well, not quite. The problem is that it will take most players about **40 hours** to reach chapter 5. Most players (like me) will likely be already burnt out from completing menial fetch quests, gathering useless materials, and mashing 'A' to skip uneventful, voiceless cutscenes.

So, when I reached Chapter 5 and the game introduced me to its largest region, the Cadensia Region, I wasn't eager to explore its vast, endless sea. Instead, I was tempted to drop the game altogether.

This brings me to my next point.

### An Empty, Unrewarding World
Once the game *does* open up, players will discover that there's not really much to discover in Aionios. Sure, there are dozens of enemies wandering around the game's open areas, and the player's minimap is often covered with icons, suggesting a litany of people and things to discover.

So, I suppose that "nothing to discover" isn't technically accurate. But I *can* say that there's nothing *useful* or *interesting* to find.

This is partially because, unlike past games, almost everything in the world of Aionios is marked on the game's map, removing the mystery and wonder of exploration. And once player's have found an item or event, the corresponding map markers disappear. So, when there's no icons left on the minimap, that's the cue to players that there's nothing left to discover. Sure, one could argue that this is a time-saving mechanic, but I'd argue that by removing the mystery of exploration, the incentive to explore vanishes. It certainly did for me, at least. Imagine if Zelda: Breath of the wild had every fairy fountain, shrine, and Korok seed on its minimap?

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xc3minimap.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">The minimap is almost <i>too</i> helpful at times, removing the need for players to actually learn the game's topography.</span>
</div>

The other reason is that, despite the myriad of icons on the minimap, there's really only three things that the player can find:

1. Colonies
2. Item Containers
3. Unique Overworld Monsters

XC3's colony system is half-baked, being a terrible substitute for <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Remember Torigoth from Xenoblade Chronicles 2, or Colony 9 from Xenoblade 1? These massive, intricate cities were fun to explore, and helped establish a feeling that real people lived in these worlds. XC3\'s colonies feel absolutely desolate by comparison.'">the kinds of cities one would typically encounter in an RPG</text-with-tooltip>. This is because the game's colonies are practically identical. Other than having a different item shop, a different Hero, and a different backdrop, there's nothing to distinguish the colonies from each other; In fact, during my playthrough, I'd frequently get colonies confused, fast traveling to one when I meant to go to another. 

The game initially makes a huge deal out of these colonies, urging players to maximize each colony's "affinity chart". But to me, there's no reason to care about it because, proportionally, the rewards are absolutely meager compared to the work required for them. Think "Increased Swimming Speed" is an adequate reward for completing several lengthy fetch quests? No, not even close. And the "relationships" built between each colony's citizens mostly consist of nothing more than a handful of unvoiced textboxes.

Worse, these colonies contain about [a dozen or so NPCs](https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/Colony_Iota), making the world of Aionios feel positively tiny. During my playthrough, it felt as if there were no more than 100 people, total, living in Aionis. I don't care if the sparseness of the colonies is "story-relevant"; it's a direct contradiction to the "wide open world" image that the game desperately tries to convey. 

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xc3colony.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">A couple of tents, a cafeteria, and some metallic structures and barricades. Sure, one colony might be in the snowy mountains, and another might be in a cave, but they all look like this.</span>
</div>

So, since the colony system in XC3 is lackluster, what about these "Item Containers"? At least players are rewarded with sweet loot, right?

Not exactly. These containers dispense <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'I recently became aware that in section A, subsection B, article 12 of the Geneva Convention, all games must have crafting systems, regardless of whether the system is fun.'">crafting materials</text-with-tooltip>, gemstones, and gold, each one being completely useless in its own way:

- the requirements for crafting are so random and arbitrary that the chances of actually getting something useful is incredibly slim.
- The amount of gemstones that a player need is actually capped to the couple hundreds. I reached the max amount after about 30 hours, so every subsequent gemstone I found was unceremoniously auto-sold.
- Gold is only used to buy accessories, and in my playthrough, the accessories on sale have *never* been better than what I currently had equipped. Gold is so useless that it makes me think that Monolith Soft simply forgot about it during development.

I'm not exaggerating when I say that there was only a *single* time that I managed to find something useful in one of these containers: a unique accessory. And sure enough, after some research, I found that there's only [7 of these special containers in the entire game](https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/Container). Given that there's hundreds of these containers in XC3, the chances of the player finding anything worthwhile is slim.

So, when everything is marked on the map, and 99% of what a player will find is disposable or uninteresting, there really isn't a compelling reason for the player to spend any time exploring Aionios. *This* is why Cadensia Region's grand reveal was dread-inducing instead of exciting. I wasn't thinking, "Yay! I get to explore!", but rather, "Oh god, let's get this over with".

But what about the battle system that I heavily praised? Beating down tough bosses can be its own reward, right?

### A Time Consuming Grind
Despite XC3 making an honest effort to respect the player's time (auto saving, auto selling, a great navigation system, etc), this effort feels entirely absent from some of game's other elements. The most egregious offender, by far, is the game's battle system.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xc3chain.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Chain attacks are flashy, but become a chore to execute, especially when the 2-3 of them you'll need to finish off a boss tack on an extra 5 minutes to the battle.</span>
</div>

I stand by my previous praise for the game's battle system, I really do. It's a wonderfully complex system that rewards careful study and patience, but is flexible enough to accommodate any kind of playstyle. The game's first half can be thrilling at times because both the party *and* the enemy have relatively tiny reserves of HP: battles are brisk and exciting, and witnessing a huge swath of enemy HP disappear after executing a powerful attack is immensely satisfying.

But unfortunately, towards the latter half of the game, battles become a test of *patience*, rather than skill. Starting around chapter 5, legendary monsters and bosses are given disproportionate buffs to their HP and lethality. Gone is the satisfaction from landing a powerful blow, as even the most powerful attacks deplete only a sliver of HP. As a result, many battles drag on for an upwards of 10-15 minutes. I'm not joking. And that's **if** players beat a boss on their first try.

Since enemies become so resilient and lethal in the latter half of the game, Chain Attacks become both the only way to deal any significant damage (making the combo system practically useless), and the only way to survive (by stopping lethal blows and giving yourself time to heal). 

The problem with this game's Chain Attack system is that it *stops time*. In theory, this is good because it allows the player to craft the perfect sequence of 20-30 attacks, ensuring high damage output. But in practice, it's *terrible* because one Chain Attack takes about 3 minutes to execute. Since most bosses will require about 2-3 chain attacks to defeat, the average length of a battle will approach 20-25 minutes, which is *simply far too long*.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xc3blong.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">The game's Consul boss battles towards the later half of the game are particularly grueling.</span>
</div>

As a result, instead of being eager to take on higher-leveled enemies as I progressed, I was eager to *avoid* them. But true to its JRPG roots, many quests require the player to trudge through narrow passageways filled with endless, respawning enemies, so an avoidance strategy only goes so far in XC3. This game's last 15 hour stretch is easily the worst part of the game due to this.

So, at this point, I've established that the game's "open world" is a unrewarding chore to traverse, and the game's battle system crumbles under the weight of poorly-balanced enemy stats. What, then, does that leave for the player to enjoy?

This a JRPG, right? Surely its story and characters are wacky, zany, and fun?

### Lifeless Characters
Rather than discuss the plot, I first want to discuss XC3's characters because **it's the characters, not the plot, that are the most important elements of a good story**. The most interesting premise in the world wouldn't be able to save a story with lifeless characters. Inversely, some of the best games/shows of our generation have paper-thin plots, and are carried by their likable characters and nuanced portrayals of human behavior (i.e. the works of Shinchiro Watanabe). 

While this topic deserves a separate essay, I'll spare you the details and leave you with a brilliantly-concise quote on the importance of characters in a story:

<info-box :source-name="'How to Develop a Fictional Character: 6 Tips for Writing Great Characters'" :source-link="'https://www.masterclass.com/articles/writing-tips-for-character-development'">While a mastery of plot can help you develop exciting twists and turns, great character development draws readers in by giving them strong characters with whom they can identify.[...] Character and plot are inseparable, because a person is what happens to them. Without a clear sense of who a character is, what they value, and what they’re afraid of, the reader will be unable to appreciate the significance of your events, and your story will have no impact.</info-box>

In that sense, the way that characters behave and develop is critically important in getting the audience invested in a story. They must be both realistic yet interesting, unique yet relatable, active yet contemplative. When a likable character falls, we feel pain. When a likable character triumphs, it's as if *we've* triumphed, too.

XC3, unfortunately, fails its characters in the worst way possible, and it's not because they're annoying, unlikeable, or poorly voice-acted. No, XC3's fails because its main characters are some of the most robotic, lifeless, and uninteresting characters of any game that I've played in the past 10 years. The best way that I can describe them is **unbearably inoffensive**.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xcboring.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Like many JRPGs, XC3 doesn't seem to understand the concept of <a href="https://self-publishingschool.com/show-dont-tell-writing/">Show, Don't Tell</a></span>
</div>

This is not, however, immediately apparent in the opening hours of XC3 because the game. The game's first 5-10 hours contain several charming, nuanced cutscenes that show off the colorful sides of the game's main cast. I'll admit that I was fooled into thinking that I was getting myself into a gripping, character-driven narrative.

The game continues this charade by making each member of the main character a little "broken" in some way, giving off the illusion of depth. For example, Eunie has PTSD from a previous encounter with a villain. Taion lives with shame because he blames himself for the death of his ~~crush~~ friend. Sena's desperation for acceptance from her peers has made her lose her sense of self. Most characters struggle like this in some way.

In that sense, XC3 certainly plants the seeds for compelling character arcs, but unfortunately, we don't get to see the process by which these seeds blossom. Instead (to continue this silly metaphor), players stare at these seeds for 80 hours until, *poof*, they suddenly become giant oak trees.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xc3sena.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">XC3 spends a lot of time telling us that Sena's psyche is overly-reliant on praise and validation from others, but this is completely irrelevant to her part in the game's story.</span>
</div>

For example, the characters *tell us* that "Mio" is troubled about her impending 10-year death, but we never see that fear play out. The characters *tell us* about Taion's guilt, but it never factors into his decision making (aside from some minor events in an entirely-optional side quest). The characters *tell us* that Lanz is torn up over a betrayal from one of his long-time friends, but this never affects his behavior or his attitude towards his other friends.

In short, these characters claim to be "broken", despite not acting like it. Instead, each character is intelligent, rational, trusting, and kind, but the game blatantly and explicitly tries to tell players something to the contrary. Repeatedly and endlessly. It *tells* us, but never *shows* us.

In addition to lacking any sort of believable character development, XC3's characters don't *behave* like humans, either: they never debate, and they never disagree. They always assume the best intentions, and they never hold grudges. Aside from one bizarre moment where Mio unexplainably gets angry at Noah (and then quickly forgives him), there's no tension or drama between them to speak of. 

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xcconvo.jpg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">It may not be apparent at first, but most of the game's dialog is delivered via unvoiced, awkwardly-animated scenes filled with text boxes.</span>
</div>

But...shouldn't there be? If multiple universes were on the brink of total annihilation, and the world's citizens were forced into constant servitude, don't you think the game's protagonists might have different opinions on how to handle this? Don't you think that they'd get a little hot-headed at times? Don't you think that tensions would rise, feelings would get hurt, and emotional scars would be formed? 

Or, more outrageously, don't you think learning about <span class="spoiler">babies and sex</span> would drastically alter the dynamics between 6 young adults?

Monolith Soft doesn't seem to think so. Instead, XC3 is content to *tell* us how this long journey has changed these characters, instead of demonstrating this to its players in any meaningful way.

So, when XC3's players characters repeatedly chirp that they've "changed" by the game's conclusion, these proclamations ring hollow because the game hasn't given its audience any reason to believe it. In reality, they haven't changed one bit: they're the same logical, understanding people that they've always been. And this makes them feel like walking plot devices, rather than relatable human beings.

This is exacerbated by a wonky, uneven localization. At times, characters don't even properly respond to direct questions, and non-sequiturs are frequent throughout the game's script. It's almost as if the game's script was generated by an AI (or thrown through a Japanese-to-English translator program), rather than written by an actual person.

  <span class="text--secondary">XC3 fumbles this moment with robotic dialog and lifeless character interactions.</span>
</div>

What, then, did I feel for the game's main cast as the end credits began to roll? Honestly, not much. I couldn't see myself, or anyone else for that matter, in Noah or Mio. So when they persevered, I felt nothing.  

In all honesty, I'm *just barely* able to restrain myself from saying that I prefer Xenoblade Chronicles 2's obnoxious cast of characters to this crew. Sure, those characters suffered from terrible writing and one-dimensionality, *but at least they were fun*.

Also, notice that I haven't even touched on the "Hero" characters. This is because most of them are only obtainable through optional sidequsts. This means that, outside of the one or two quests that directly pertain to a given Hero, the player won't hear a peep out of them for the rest of the game. These Hero characters are, quite literally, irrelevant to plot. And since they're mostly optional, don't expect to any of their relationships with the main cast to matter, either.

  <span class="text--secondary">Isurd wins the award for least interesting character in the game. It doesn't help that his voice actor sounds as if he's just woken up from a naps.</span>
</div>

Before you angrily reach for your pitchfork, *yes*, there are occasional sparks of life in XC3's characters, and those sparks sometimes shine *very* brightly. The "jail" cutscene, in particular, is one of the most heart-wrenching, masterfully-crafted cutscenes in the entire Xenoblade franchise. There's also a <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'It\'s the scene where Taion notices that Eunie\'s hands are shaking'">touching scene</text-with-tooltip> between Taion and Eunie that suggests that someone at Monolith Soft *might* understand the concept of "Show, don't tell". And finally, yes, Eunie can be a hoot.

But ultimately, these glimmers of humanity get absolutely crushed under this game's 60 hours of tactless, repetitive noise, making it impossible to truly connect with any of these characters. For a studio that obviously [spent a lot of time designing the ultra-likeable Shulk](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/08/random-xenoblade-chronicles-shulk-cutscene-was-originally-a-little-creepy) from Xenoblade Chronicles, I was honestly shocked at how indifferent I was to Noah and Mio.

### An Long, Uneventful Story
I've mentioned a few times that XC3 is a *long* game. This isn't necessarily a problem, as lots of great games have long runtimes. Whether it's because of a compelling gameplay loop or an exciting storyline, games like Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Skyrim, and The Witcher 3 prove that it's possible to captivate audiences for dozens of hours.

But the same cannot be said for XC3. I reached the end of the game about a month ago, and yet I'm sitting here, struggling to recall what *actually happened* in the story. Sure, players will learn more about the XC3 universe and its characters over the course of the narrative, but there's surprisingly little activity over the game's 60 hour runtime. Or at least, activity that involves *the player*.

Off the top of my head, I can only think of <span class="spoiler">blowing up the big world-destroying laser, reaching The City, going to Prison, getting a random key from Nia, and fighting Consul Z</span>. That's it. Now, try to imagine how *on earth* this game can stretch these events over the span of 60 hours. Obviously, it can't.

Instead, for some reason, XC3 feels compelled to thwart any kind of narrative momentum as soon as things start to get going. I'm not exaggerating when I say that it takes about 30 hours for XC3 for a major event to occur, and when it does, that momentum is immediately squandered with an endless deluge of voiceless textbox-driven cutscenes and dreadful, laborious fetch quests.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xc3text2.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">XC3 devotes a ton of time to side characters, all of who are barely-relevant to the game or its main characters. Some could call it "world-building", but given how uninteresting this kind of content is, I'd call it "filler".</span>
</div>


Part of the problem, I think, is that <span class="spoiler">most of the events integral to XC3's plot have *already happened* by the time the player picks up a controller. Noah has already impregnated Mio a bunch of times and succumbed to the dark side, Melia and Nia have already constructed Origin and left to take naps, and Consul Z as already set his plan in motion for "the endless now".</span>

One of the hardest challenges for a story that is centered around <span class="spoiler">death and rebirth is that, when the story mostly focuses on the past, it doesn't leave a lot of room for the present. Zelda: Breath of the Wild shares this issue with XC3 in that the player isn't an active agent for most of the story's narrative events.</span> So, instead of being an active participant in major plot events, this game makes players wait on the sidelines until the dust has settled, making the player feel disconnected from the narrative's progression.

For example, Ethel and Cammuravi supposedly have a long, storied rivalry? Supposedly, Crys was incredibly inspiring to Noah when he was younger? Supposedly, everybody has always loved Joran? Really?

I don't care how many sepia-toned flashbacks the game throws at me: telling an audience to care about characters, but not spending the time or effort to develop those relationships organically, is a terrible way to tell a story.

This is why XC3's length is so baffling to me: it clearly has no problem asking the player to spend 60+ hours on it. But in return, the player has practically nothing to show for it, narratively speaking, at the game's conclusion. 

I won't even get into the number of plot threads that the game's ending never addresses (i.e. *who*, exactly, is Riku?). I sincerely hope that this is due to a rushed development cycle, rather than a ploy to get players to buy additional DLC down the line.

### An Anti-Climactic Conclusion
On one final note, as a Xenoblade series fan, I can't help but mention how disappointing XC3's ending is. I'll admit that this criticism isn't relevant for those that haven't played Xenoblade Chronicles 1 or 2, but I think it deserves to be said.

Xenoblade Chronicles 1 ended with a huge, earth-shattering twist that recontextualized its entire plot. Xenoblade 2 <span class="spoiler"> obscured its connection to the previous game until the very end, </span> greatly expanding on the series lore and providing major contextual twists of its own.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xc2.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">For those that played Xenoblade Chronicles 2, I'm sad to report that there's no equivalent scene like this in XC3.</span>
</div>

But unlike its predecessors, XC3 stumbles and sputters over the finish line. There's hardly any lore revelations, and there aren't any major twists (that aren't painfully obvious). 

Instead, the game simply wraps up its mostly self-contained storyline as unceremoniously as possible. In fact, it veers *dangerously close* to the <span class="spoiler">"It was all a dream! Or...was it?"</span> trope, although one could argue for [more nuanced interpretation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXQ7X7UMVMo). Still, in the context of its predecessors, it's shocking to me that <span class="spoiler">, almost literally, </span> almost nothing happens by the end of the game.

I suppose that I'm probably coming across as an "entitled gamer", but I expected more from this series. Hell, the only reason I put 100 hours into this game was because of the faint hope that, like its predecessors, XC3's conclusion would rock my world.

The most noteworthy thing that came from the game's final cutscene was a contrived, totally unearned <span class="spoiler">kiss between Mio and Noah. I recognize that it's against the law to *not* have JRPG male and female protagonists fall for each other, but this particular romance felt especially inorganic and completely forced.</span>. 

Crap game, crap characters, crap ending.

## Conclusion
I kid, I kid. It seems like the more I think about this game's wasted potential, the more frustrated I get, hence the increasingly-angry tone towards the end of this review.

But wow, that's a whole lot of words. Still with me? 

Maybe I've taken things too far. Maybe a game like XC3 doesn't need a 20,000 page essay. Maybe it's simply meant to be appreciated for what it is: a sophomoric JRPG that has some serious mechanical and technical merits, but hasn't outgrown its awkward JRPG roots. Maybe it deserves to be loved, warts and all, for what it sets out to do?

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xc3end.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">If nothing else, XC3 succeeds it sets high expectations for Xenoblade Chronicles 4.</span>
</div>

That's certainly a valid viewpoint; I would never take that away from someone, since that's how I feel about Xenoblade Chronicles 2. I would never call it a "perfect" game, but it *is* one of my favorites. Unfortunately, I can't say the same thing about Xenoblade Chronicles 3, but maybe others *can*.

Still, for all the things that XC3 does wrong, there's enough good stuff here to both make this a game (potentially, depending on your own gaming tastes) worth playing, and a stepping stone towards something great. Fantastic, even.

Hopefully, Monolith Soft will be granted more time, a bigger budget, better hardware, and a pandemic-free environment when they start their next adventure. 

I'll be eagerly waiting for it, listening to XC3's soundtrack in the meantime.
