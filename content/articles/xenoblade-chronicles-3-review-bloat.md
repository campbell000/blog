## Disclaimers
* I will keep plot-specific details to a minimum, but beware: this post may contain some minor, early spoilers for Xenoblade Chronicles 3, and some vague spoilers for Xenoblade Chronicles 2.
* I completed the game on the "Hard" difficulty, and also completed most of its side quests. This took me about 120 hours.
* I am a *huge* fan of Xenoblade Chronicles 1 and 2 (despite how flawed the latter turned out to be).

## Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Punctuates Nintendo's Venerated Series
Almost 5 years after the relase of Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 (henceforth referred to as "XC3") is finally here. As the third game the Xenoblade Chronicles series, its director [was quoted as saying](https://nintendoeverything.com/monolith-soft-shares-xenoblade-chronicles-3-message-another-tease-of-the-future/) that this game can be considered the end of the story that started with <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'The events of Xenoblade 1 and 2 were kicked off by Klaus, a power-hungry scientist that activated a poorly-understood technological artifact that ended up splitting the universe in two.'">Klaus' experiment,</text-with-tooltip> but not the end of the Xenoblade series. In other words, "a stopping point". A resting place. A period in which the team and the fans can gather their thoughts, reflect on past experiences, and ponder where the series will go next. Xenoblade is not gone, but it's likely to go away for a while.

So, as ~the conclusion~ a "stopping point" for this beloved JRPG series, how does Xenoblade Chronicles 3 fare? 

Given that Xenoblade Chronicles 3 takes a minimum of [62 hours to beat](https://howlongtobeat.com/game/103825), which doesn't include the 30-40 hours of additional content, there's no way that I'd be able to answer that question in a two-page essay. And since [game reviewers don't need to finish games anymore](https://twitter.com/raveofravendale/status/1496533451096440838?lang=en), a long-form review of this game <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'No, I don\'t think game reviewers need to kill themselves to complete game in 24 hours to review it. But wouldn\'t you raise an eyebrow if I told you that I read through 65% of George Orwell\'s novel 1984, and flatly told you that it sucks?'">doesn't seem to exist.</text-with-tooltip>

So, much like Xenoblade Chronicles 3 itself, I'm going to take *way too long* to explain to you what I think and how I feel. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is certainly a ride, but not necessarily fun from start to finish.

Let's get started.

## Outstanding in Many Respects
It goes without saying that <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'While it\'s difficult to determine their exact contribution, Monolithsoft had a significant hand in Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I theorize that they were tapped for their expertise in open-world games, showcased excellently in Xenoblade Chronicles on the Wii.'">Monolithsoft's work on Nintendo's consoles is unparalleled</text-with-tooltip>: the environments in Xenoblade Chronicles 1 pushed Nintendo's aging Wii console to its limits, and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 offered Nintendo Switch fans a glimpse into what Nintendo's new console was capable of, upping the ante from Xenoblade 1 in many respects.

It's no surprise, then, that Xenoblade Chronicles 3 continues that trend.

### A Stunning Technical Achievement
<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/xc3gif.JPG'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Xenoblade Chronicles 3 occasionally makes you forgot that you're playing a game on an mobile processor from 2017. This game's technical and artistic aspects are, at times, execeptional.</span>
</div>

Both artistically and technically, this game is leaps and bounds ahead of anything else on the Switch. Simply compare the screenshot above to this screenshot of  <a target="_blank" href="/pokemon.jpg">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</a>. That comparison should speak for itself.

The landscapes are vast, the character models are detailed and expressive, <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Xenoblade Chronicles 2\'s lighting system gave characters an awful plastic-looking shine. Xenoblade 3\'s lighting system gives character models a much more realistic-looking glow.'">the lighting system is greatly improved</text-with-tooltip>, and there is a significant increase in the number of onscreen characters and enemies. More impressive is the fact that, despite all of these improvements, I noticed very little <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Pop-in and LOD culling involves either removing objects on screen, or using a lower-detailed version of that object, when the object is far from the player\'s view. With both approaches, the idea is that the player won\'t notice, thereby conserving computing power and memory for objects that the player can actually see.'">pop-in and LOD culling</text-with-tooltip> that many games nowadays tend to use and abuse.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xcneon.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">In addition to the game's technical chops, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 makes intelligent use of neon colors to make environments pop.</span>
</div>

These improvements aren't simply for the pixel-counters and the framerate snobs, though. Instead, I'd argue that these improvements help Xenoblade Chronicles 3 feel like a *real, living universe*. It's biomes are teeming with personality and life, which helps evoke a nostalgic, childlike sense of adventure. Part of the Xenoblade Chronicles series' appeal is its stunning, varied environments, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3 definitely delivers.

This is important because exploration is a large part of Xenoblade Chronicles 3's appeal: much of the player's time will be spent traversing the game's varied, ethereal landscapes. Despite a lack of any real secrets to discover or treasures to find (which I'll get to later), I'll admit that simply being able to observe the <a target="_blank" href="/xc3vista.gif">sun setting behind a vast expanse of distant mountains </a>for the first time was a real treat.

### A Mature, Consistent Narrative
<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/xcstory.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">XC3's dedication to its grim world and mature characters make the stakes feel real, rather than contrived.</span>
</div>

Let's talk about Xenoblade Chronicles 2, this game's predecessor, for a second. Xenoblade Chronicles 2's critical reception was divisive in many respects, but one common criticism was that the game was "too anime". Even though <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'It implies that anime is inherently childish and silly, which is simply not true. Yes, anime meant for children and teens can be silly and obnoxious, but anime exists for many demographics. There are houndreds of anime shows that are thoughtful, mature, and nuanced.'">I take issue with this phrase,</text-with-tooltip> I mostly agree with the sentiment: despite Xenoblade 2's attempts to establish a complex narrative that spans multiple universes, its efforts are undermined by the game's proclivity for [fanservice](https://gintendo-namer.squarespace.com/articles/2018/2/5/xenoblade-the-sjw-article), [penis jokes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMBRC1dHALY), [accidental boob touching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc-u936MOB4), and [ridiculoud-looking outfits](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/xenoblade/images/6/64/XC2_Pyra_artwork.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20171110014440). This is made worse by a shoddy North American localization and some <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Alledgedly, the terrible performances are due to the voice actors and actresses being rushed, as well as being given little/no direction as to the appropriate tone for a scene. I can believe that.'">absolutely *terrible* voice acting performances</text-with-tooltip>, which ensures that any attempts at humor land with a thud.

I'm not here to shame people for enjoying sexiness and silliness, but for a series like Xenoblade Chronicles, scenes like this are incongruous with the seriousness of the game's conflict. Is this an epic sci-fi novel, or a harem-style romantic comedy?

Xenoblade Chronicles 3, thankfully, swings the pendulum back towards Xenoblade 1's more-mature tone (and maybe even further). Speaking to Nintendo, the game's developers had this to say about the character design process: 

<info-box :source-name="'Ask the Developer Vol. 6, Xenoblade Chronicles 3–Part 2'" :source-link="'https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-6-xenoblade-chronicles-3-part-2/'">
[S]ince the story is more serious than the previous titles, we designed the characters to look more mature by making them taller. We also designed the costumes to be not too flashy to match the tone of the story. [...] We asked Saito-san to tailor the overall design, including the clothing, to a dignified style that fits a serious story. 
</info-box>

Look no further for proof of this darker tone than the game's opening cutscene: as battles between Agnus and Keves soldiers rage on, the player is forced to bear witness to this war's terrible consequences. Rotting corpses and wounded soldiers litter the battlefield as soliders celebrate a brief, temporary victory, only to be forced to fight again tomorrow. <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Well, as gruesome as it can possibly be for a T-rated game.'">It's a gruesome sight</text-with-tooltip>, reminding players that in the world of Aionios, there are no winners. Instead, this pointless conflict ensures that everyone loses.

This war-torn, dystopian world has clearly taken its toll on the game's main cast, who are afflicted with bouts of anxiety, despair, and hopelessness. Despite its fantasy setting, Xenoblade Chronicles 3's characters endure struggles that may be all-too-familiar to the player (feelings of inadequacy, a fear of death, etc), making their struggles feel real and, perhaps, personal.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xc3sad.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Helped by a mature script and mostly-great voice acting, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 makes its characters' problems feel real and relatable.</span>
</div>

In general, unlike Xenoblade Chronicles 2, this game never fails to remind the player that the stakes of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 are high: the world is inherently cruel, and innocent people are suffering.

That's not to say it's *all* doom and gloom, though. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 smartly breaks things up by sprinkling bits of levity throughout its narrative. But again, unlike Xenoblde Chronicles 2, these moments don't feel out of place in an epic sci-fi adventure. Instead, these moments lend humanity to the main cast of characters as they try to make light of a terrible existence. 

In that sense, it's refreshing to see Monolithsoft take its universe a little more seriously, and I'd argue that those efforts paid off in a more compelling, more believable narrative.

### An Unwieldy, But Incredibly Rewarding, Battle System
<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/xc3battle.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">This screenshot will probably look bewildering to those unfamiliar with Xenoblade. There's lots to learn about XC3's battle system, but in my opinion, it's worth learning.</span>
</div>

I've dedicated most of this review so far to the game's environments and narrative. This is because you'll spend about half of your playtime exploring, watching, and listening. This is a *good* thing, since I'd argue that the game's world is interesting and complex.

But the other half of your playtime will either be spent battling, or preparing for battle. Let me explain.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3's battle system is complicated. Perhaps maybe a little *too* complicated. It builds off of Xenoblade 1 and 2's systems, so I can't speak to how intimiding and confusing it might be for a new player, but I *can* say that it's one of the most complicated battle systems in any game that I've played. In addition, the game introduces new wrinkles and features into the battle system as the player progresses, so I'd argue that a player likely won't feel comfortable with the battling until about half-way through the game.

But while that sounds like a negative thing, I'd argue that this actually *helps* the player come to grips with the wonderful flexibility that the game has to offer. Things are <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Well, relative to how complicated the battle system gets by the end of the game.'">relatively simple</text-with-tooltip> at first: the game teaches you how to auto-attack, how to use Arts (special moves that deal more damage), and other basic mechanics (swapping characters, equipping accessories, leveling up, etc). If you've played a JRPG before, the basics will click fairly quickly.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xc3sena.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Xenoblade Chroincles 3's menus smartly hide much of the game's complexity in sub-menus, which gives players the option to either quickly scan the important stuff, or dive into the finer nuances of each characters abilities, stats, and equipment.</span>
</div>

Then, one by one as you progress, the game introduces more mechanics: <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'abilities that you can learn from and borrow from other classes'">Master Artes and Master Skills</text-with-tooltip>, <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Performing two Artes at the same time, combining their effects'">Fusion Artes</text-with-tooltip>, <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Super-powered forms that characters can assume for a limited time'">Oroborous Forms</text-with-tooltip>, and <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Stops time and allows players to attack enemies repeatedly'">Chain Attacks</text-with-tooltip>. I'll admit that the game's constant use of made-up RPG jargon got overwhelming at times, and despite the game offering an abunadnce of tutorials to ease players into these new mechanics, I'd often not fully grasp <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'It took me several hours to realize that the the Ouroboros forms were effectively “Oh Shit! Don\'t Die!” buttons. '">the point of a mechanic</text-with-tooltip> until several hours later. And yes, Xenoblade Chronicles 2's constant tutorials, [famously memed on by Dunkey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiVZMxf4E2Q), are back to relentlessly annoy players for the first 20 hours.

But after about 20 hours, something awesome happened: the mental burden of Xenobalde Chronicles 3's numerous mechanics began to ease, and I started to view these mechanics as tools instead of a source of confusion. 

What do I mean by this? Well, to give you some examples: want to turn Eunie, one of the game's default healers, into a critical-hit landing powerhouse? How about a tank that is frail but impossible to hit? Or maybe you'd rather put her in a support role that has insane synergies with one of your other attackers?

In Xenoblade Chronicles 3, not only is this possible, but it's actively *encouraged*. The game rewards (and explicitly recommends) you to constantly change your characters' classes, and by doing so, they'll permanently learn skills and abilities from other classes. For example, if you change Lanz, the game's tank, to a healer class, they'll learn a healing skill that they can use *no matter what class you assign them*. Put simply, it's *fun and incredibly rewarding* to see how one character (say, a healer) might benefit from donning a different hat (say, an attacker's). Maybe they'll learn a skill that helps their healing artes have less cooldown, or maybe they'll learn a skill that can reduce agro?

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xc3fusion.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Xenoblade Chronicles 3's "Fusion Art" system opens the door for endless experimentation with each character's arts. It's a little overwhelming, but incredibly satisfying when you land on that perfect combination.</span>
</div>

One other notable feature is what the game calls "Fusion Artes". This mechanic allows players to perform two artes at once, and when doing so, any secondary effects of these artes are combined and amplified. 

For example, say you have an <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Area-Of-Effect. In other words, the attack hits all enemies in an area'">AOE</text-with-tooltip> arte, and an art that puts enemies to sleep. If you combine these two artes, the result would put *all enemies in the surrounding area to sleep*. 

The art fusions possibilities are endless. Want a fusion art that both <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'RPG-speak for an attack that ignores any damage reduction incurred from an enemy\'s defenses'">pierces</text-with-tooltip> and crits? Or how about a fusion art that can buff your team and debuff an enemy at the same time? What about a fusion art that heals *twice*? All of these combinations are fair game. 

And on one final note, the game doesn't *force* playes to deal with this complexity. When switching classes, the game helpfully sets some sensible defaults for arts, accessories, fusions, etc. So if you want total control of your team's composition, have at it! But if you'd rather not sweat the small stuff and just enjoy the ride, the game can handle that, too.

In short, yes, the game's mechanics are initially bewildering. But I'd argue that there's nothing quite like spending a good 20 minutes finding the perfect combination of classes and Arts, and then *beating the absolute shit* out of a previously-troublesome boss. These moments can be exhilirating, and servce to vindicate any initial struggles a player may have with the game's battle system.

## Disappointing in Many Respects
If you couldn't tell by now, there's is a *lot* to love about Xenoblade Chronicles 3. But just like the world of Aionios that pits two sides against each other in endless conflict, there is another side to Xenoblade Chronicles 3 that drags the entire experience down. That's not to say that the game is irredeemable, but there are some serious problems with this game. 

Just note that I don't derive pleasure from criticizing this game, and I'm not being contrarian for contrarian's sake. Rather, my hope is that this next section will start a discussion on some of the things that future Xenoblade games could improve.

### Graphically Overambitious
I stand by what I said before about Xenoblade's technical merits: Monolithsoft has succeeded in creating an open world that is both marvelous to look at and compelling to explore. But unfortunately, it seems like Monolithsoft needed to make significant compromises to make this happen.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xcblurry.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">At best, Xenoblade's image quality is "soft", but inoffensive. At worst, the game has a serious legibility problem.</span>
</div>

Like most Switch games, [XC3 employs a technique called "dynamic resolution"](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-xenoblade-chronicles-3-nintendo-switch-tech-review), which is designed to make intelligent resolution/framerate tradeoffs: when scenes are static, resolution is high, and when scenes are filled with characters and effects, resolution is sacrificed to keep framerates stable. In theory, this is best-of-both-worlds solution: image quality is good when it needs to be, and framerates are stable when they needs to be. The Splatoon series, for example, owes its rock-solid 60 frames-per-second to an aggresive dynamic resolution strategy. 

But for XC3, however, this framerate/resolution trdaeoff is neither appealing or effective. Instead, Xenoblade 3 seems to buckle under the weight of its own ambitions: image quality is rarely crisp, and gets even *worse* during battles. I'm not typically a resolution snob, but in many instances during battle, the game's poor image quality made it difficult to make sense out of all of the characters, lines, circles, and effects.

I'm not lying when I say that it would typically take me a few seconds to orient myself at the beginning of a battle or when switching characters due to how poor the game's image quality can be. Losing track of enemies and teammates, especially during multi-enemy fights, was a common occurance, and I can't help but wonder if battles would be more legible if image quality was improved.

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/xc3battle.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">XC3's battle system has a legibility problem: XC3's poor image quality and low resolution makes it difficult to make sense of hectic battles. I learned to deal with it, but it never stopped being a frustrating. Switch Pro, when?</span>
</div>

Despite the hit to image quality, dynamic resolution doesn't seem to be enough to keep the framerate stable. Simply walking around some of the more-densely populated areas incurs a notable stutter. Ribbi Flats is one example of an area that *never* seemed to run smoothly for me, constantly hitching and stuttering. Worse still, XC3 actually *slows down* when the framerate drops, making it difficult to get the timing right on certain attacks.

Again, these complaints aren't coming from a place of snobbery. Rather, Xenoblade's image and performance problems disrupt gameplay, which I consider to be one of the worst cardinal sins that a game developer can commit.

One final note: it's apparent that the Switch couldn't handle rendering some of XC3's cutscenes in realtime, which forced Monolithsoft to <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'In other words, record scenes on powerful development hardware so that framerates are stable, save it to a video file, and have the Switch simply play that video'">pre-render</text-with-tooltip> them. 

Pre-rendered cutscenes aren't inherently bad, however. They allows the developers to think big in terms of scale, and when done well, the player won't even notice (i.e. Final Fantasy VII Remake).

But frankly, some of the pre-rendered cutscenes in Xenoblade Chronicles 3 look absolutely **terrible**: it's as if Monolithsoft used badly-compressed, low-resolution Youtube videos in their own game! From the game's opening moments to its dramatic climax, most of this game's cinematic setpieces are riddled with [compression artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_artifact) and bizarre [color banding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_banding).

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xcblur.png'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Again, take note of the artifacting and color banding in the white light. This is actually how it looks in-game.</span>
</div>

Rather than simple incompetence, I suspect that Monolilthsoft were stuck between a rock and a hard place: the Switch clearly can't handle some of the game's more-complex scenes, but at the same time, I'm sure that Monolithsoft had to aggressively compress these videos in order to fit all of them on a Switch cartridge. While I can sympathize with the difficulty of this problem, it doesn't change the fact that XC3's cutscenes can be distractingly ugly at times.

### Lifeless Characters

STORY MATTERS BECAUSE ITS A STORY DRIVEN GAME


As I said above, I appreciate Xenoblade Chronicles 3's commitment to a more mature narrative. It helps ground the game's otherwise-fantastical story. But in their dedication to a more serious tone, they've inadvertently sucked all personality from its characters. 

This is an issue because **it's the characters, not the plot, that an audience latches on to**. As human beings, we are hardwired to care about other humans in real life: it's wonderful, but also a necessity for the survival of our species. 

One unintended consequence of this biological fact is that our silly, primative brains tend to get caught up in caring about fictional humans in fictional stories. Humans simply love getting to know, and getting immersed in, the lives of fictional human characters. We want to see them struggle, but ultimately persevere, because that's what we hope for ourselves. When a likeable character triumphs, it's as if *we've* triumphed, too.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xcboring.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">The writing of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 continues this series' tradition of repeatedly violating the Golden Rule of story telling: <a href="https://self-publishingschool.com/show-dont-tell-writing/">Show, Don't Tell</a></span>
</div>

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 features an unusually large main cast, and the circumstances surrounding their lives are fraught with hardship and struggle. In that sense, armed with a wide canvas and a cast array of colors, I was optimistic that Monolithsoft would use these tools to craft compelling, relatable arcs for their characters.

For example: 
- Sena has always been desperate for validation and acceptance from others. What sort of experiences could have shaped her to be this way?
- Mio's impending 10-year death seems to have cast a long shadow over her every waking thought. How can she possibly cope with such a fate?
- Eunie's past haunts her, sometimes literally freezing her in her tracks. Will she ever find the strength to move past it?

But if you're hoping that Xenoblade Chronicles 3 handles these questions with thoughtfulness and subtly, well, you're going to be disappointed. 

Instead, in true JRPG fashion, these characters spend a *lot* of time talking about their issues, and they ensure that they repeat themselves dozens of times in case the player missed any of the nuance. Sure, as I've mentioned above, some of these scenes are done well. But they certainly lose their luster when the characters riff on exactly the same dialog 10 times after the fact.

Then, again in true JRPG fashion, absolutely nothing happens that concerns this character until they have to face their fear head-on. Only then do they... muster up the courage to deliver a rousing 3-minute speech in front of the rest of the heros (and sometimes the villains!) about how they've chosen a "new path", and how they've learned so much from all the people that they've met.

I'm not lying when I say that I laughed out loud during Eunie's "big moment". Just when I thought this game had the cajones to actually let their characters fail for once, Eunie was going to succumb to hear greatest fear, only for her to miraculously get over her PTSD at the last second. It felt childish, cheap, and unearned.

I'm not expecting Shakespeare, here. But for all the ways that Xenoblade Chronicles 3 manages to restrain itself from falling victim to the same tired anime/JRPG tropes, it misses the big one: it tells us, instead of showing us, about its characters.

So, what did I feel for the game's main cast as the end credits began to roll? Honestly, not much. The game's characters, and particularly Noah and Mio, didn't feel like real people that I could relate to. So when they persevered, I felt nothing.  

This is symptomatic of a large problem with Xenoblade Chronicles 3's characters: in an effort to ground the characters in a little more maturity and add a little more depth, they've also been stripped of anything that makes them unique or interesting: every one of the main characters are mature, level-headed, mostly-agreeable, and vaguely troubled about their past. Sure, Lanz is ostensibly the "hot-head" of the group (i.e. Reyn from XC1), but in practice, he's just as grounded and wise as Noah, Mio, or Taion. Likewise, Taion is clearly the "brainiac" of the group, but the game meekly gives the character a cutscene or two demonstrating his planning abilities. Otherwise? He's just like the rest of them: intelligent, introspective, and a little broken. 

Noah and Mio are probably the worst of the bunch: they're perfect characters from start to finish, and are devoid of a personality. Sure, the game *tells* us at the end that they've "changed", and that they now have "a new path to walk", but it's a superficial claim with no substance to back it up.

And despite the game featuring a large cast, Monolithsoft throws away the opportunity to create interesting interactions between them. XC3's characters rarely bicker, banter, or disagree. They never debate, and they never hold grudges. Aside from one bizarre moment where Mio unexplainably gets angry at Noah (and then quickly forgives him), there's no tension or drama between them to speak of. 

But...shouldn't there be? If multiple universes were on the brink of total annihilation, don't you think the game's protagonists might have different opinions on how to handle it? Don't you think that they'd get a little hot-headed at times? Don't you think feelings would get hurt, resentment would surface, and scars would be formed? 

Monolithsoft doesn't seem to think so. Instead, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is content to *tell* you how their long journey has changed and <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'And yes, in true anime fashion, each character took turns in telling the main villain what they\'ve learned throughout their journey. I literally cringed.'">matured them by the end of the game</text-with-tooltip>, rather than demonstrate this to the player. This results in the characters feeling hollow, rather than real.

Also take note that I haven't mentioned any other non-main character from Xenoblade Chronicles 3. This is because they are utterly forgettable, and ultimately disposable. I can't think of a single character, aside from maybe Ashera or Manana/Riku, that I had even a passing interest in. it doesn't help that the voice acting for these side characters ranges from passable at best, and sleep-inducing at worst.

In all honesty, I am *just barely* able to restrain myself from saying that I prefer the obnoxiously one-note characters from Xenoblade Chronicles 2 to this crew. Sure, those characters suffered from terrible writing and one-dimensionality, *but at least they were fun*.

Before you don your pitchforks and prepare to roast me in the comments, *yes*, there are occasional sparks of life in Xenoblade Chronicles 3's characters, and those sparks sometimes shine *very* brightly. The "jail" cutscene, in particular, is one of the most heart-wrenching, masterfully-crafted cutscenes in the entire franchise. The aforementioned scene between Taion and Eunie that I mentioned above is another scene that demonstrates both emotional depth to these characters, as well as restraint from flatly *telling* us that these characters are troubled. And finally, yes, Eunie can be a hoot.

But when the player will likely spend 80-100 hours with these characters, an hour or two of interesting character dynamics isn't nearly enough to convince anyone that these characters have any real depth, which brings me to my next point.

### A Bloated, Uneventful, and Predictable Story
I've mentioned a few times that Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is a *long* game. This isn't necessarily a problem: lots of great games have long runtimes: Zelda, The Witcher 3, Skyim, and even Xenoblade Chronicles 1 and 2 are all great examples of games that are very lengthy, but have enough interesting content to not overstay their welcome.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3, however, is not one of those games. I reached the end of the game about a month ago, and yet I'm struggling at the moment to recall what *actually* happened over the course of the story. Sure, the characters, and by extension the player, discover and learn new things about themselves and the world, but there are *very* few actual events that occur during the course of the game.

This is one of the main problems with a story that (spoilers!) is concerned with cycles of death and rebirth: when the story mostly focuses on the past, it doesn't leave a lot of room for the present. Zelda: Breath of the Wild shares this issue with Xenoblade Chronicles 3 in that there's not a lot that actually *happens*. 

Instead, we're told to care about characters simply because they have long histories together, or because they're actually from the distant past, without spending the time or energy to build those connections with the audience. I can only imagine that this would be exacerbated for players that *haven't* played Xenoblade Chronicles 1 or 2.

But for a game where nothing really happens, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 takes an unbearably long amount of time to get itself over with. At every turn, the game thwarts any kind of actual development of the story or its characters with meaningless dialog with side characters, much of which is not voiced and barely animated.

I'm not exaggerating when I say that it takes about 30 hours for Xenoblade Chronicles 3 to gain any narrative momentum, which is squandered quickly as the game piles on frivilous fetch quest after fetch quest. Sure, many of these quests are optional, but without them, the game's characters would feel even *more* hollow and lifeless, as they contain bits of pieces of additional characterization.

For example, let's say that we need to talk to the Queen of Agnus. To do that, we need to build a boat. For that, we need to find talk to Samon. He needs us to help Myori, who needs us to fight some monsters and recover some materials.

From start to finish, this mandatory quest takes about an hour, and none of it is engaging or exciting. *Most* of the quests in Xenoblade Chronicles 3 find some kind of excuse to divert you from the main goal. Character A needs help, but in order to help them, Characters B and C need help first. It's boring, frustrating, and in a genre known for bloat, it's disappointing to see Xenoblade Chronicles 3 stoop levels like this in order to pad its length.

Excruciatingly, for game that prides itself on its explorable open-world, these quests often lock you out from exploring other parts of Aionios. Trying to divert from the main quest causes the characters to chastise the player from straying from the main path, throwing up an invisible wall to quell any curiosity the player may have had.

So, the 



Want to advance the story? Sorry, you need to find 7 crystals in areas that you've already been to. Want to explore a new region? Sorry, you need to unlock a wall-climbing ability and come back later. Curious about Mobious? Too bad, you need to first resolve the conflict between two characters that you probably don't care about (Ethel and Cammuravi). None of these detours are interesting or fun, and the game's pacing suffers from their inclusions.



### Empty WORLDS RESPECT TIME

And I can't 

RESPECT TIME

But in Zelda's case, this is mitigated by a tight, fulfilling gameplay loop of fighting, exploring, and planning. Zelda's narrative doesn't overstay its welcome. For better or worse, Zelda doesn't force you to pay attention to the story, as it has other, more appealing aspects. 

Xenoblade Chronicles 3, however, isn't nearly as fortunate in that regard:
