title: Stop Putting Yourself In a Box
summary: "Lots of people (especially math/science types) tend to fall victim to the pressures of their families, friends, and peers by aspiring to be an idealized version of themselves. I think that people would be much happier if they were to aspire to be the \"best\" version of themselves. It's never too late to stop and ask yourself, \"what's important to ME, and how do I want to spend MY time?\""

## Disclaimers
* I've been making an effort to make my writing more concise and more pleasant to read. Hopefully, you'll notice that change starting with this article.
* This article may only make sense to those that have struggled with obsessiveness, perfectionism, or otherwise feeling like you've had to live up to lofty expectations. If you've been easy-going for your entire life, you may simply counter this post with "bro, just relax and do you". But in this post, I attempt to shed light on why that's not as simple it seems for some.

## Thinking Big
When someone is young (or young at heart), [they tend to think less pragmatically](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=3051). Impulsivity and emotional instability tend to dominate their decision making processes. 

There are countless studies that support this, both anecdotally and anatomically (i.e. young people's brains are actually physically different than older people's brains). While the brain is very poorly understood relative to the rest of our bodies, the health and science community is in large agreement that younger people tend to think more idealistically and irrationally than older people.

This can be a terrible thing, and also a wonderful thing. It's terrible because younger people tend to make decisions in a sub-optimal way. When making decisions, they may not consider all of the factors at play, or they may let their emotions override the need for objectivity. Some argue that these impairments are catalysts for vehicular accidents (i.e. drunk driving), unwanted pregnancies and STDs, drug use, and other major problems of the modern era. This line of thinking has led to restrictions on the drinking age, the driving age, the voting age, etc. Whether or not you agree with these restrictions, I'd argue that they are founded upon sound ideas (but may not be effective in practice).

But on the flip side, thinking less pragmatically tends to also be a *beautiful* thing because it frees the individual to ponder the truly outrageous and the utterly impractical. Consider the following questions:
* What if we put human beings on a machine and sent them to the moon?
* What if we connected all of the computers *together* to create one giant network?
* What if we poisoned someone's cells with radiation to actually *help* their bodies overcome a disease?
* What if we put Mario, Sonic, and Cloud in a fighting game?

These questions may seem tame and obvious to readers in 2021, but at certain points in history, these questions were treated with derision and intense skepticism. It took a number of brave and forward thinking individuals, ones who couldn't afford to limit their own wild imaginations, to make these hypothetical scenarios a reality.

While perhaps impulsive and irrational to many, "thinking big" is a net good to society, leading to innovation and improvement. To [allegedly](https://hbr.org/2011/08/henry-ford-never-said-the-fast) quote Henry Ford of the Ford automobile company, "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses."

</div>

Before I go any further, I don't mean to suggest that this innovative way of thinking is *exclusive* to young people, but I think many would agree that young people tend to be less aware of their own limitations. They simply have less failures and less experience to draw upon when setting goals for themselves. One *can* do great things at *any* age, but I'd argue that being foolish and a little irrational can help one ignore skepticism, whether that comes others or from one's own self-doubt.

## I Wanna Be the Very Best
Therefore, it's often at a younger age that one decides, "I'm going to be the best at something", or "I'm going to create something revolutionary", or "I'm going to change the world". It's no coincidence that many toys, TV shows, and videogames attempt to capitalize on this fantasy of being the best, or being someone that everyone else looks up to.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="medium" :src="'/ash.gif'" />
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Like many TV shows marketed to children and teens, Pokemon focuses solely on a pokemon trainer who simply "wants to be the very best, like no one ever was".</span>
</div>

For younger people, this often starts with a natural prowess or interest in a skill. This might include a music teacher urging one of their students to try out for the state's music ensemble, or it might include a local sports coach making one of their players captain of the team. It could even include an elementary school teacher making an offhand comment to a parent about a child's "natural gift" for math.

It's these little moments that tend to set an aspiration for greatness into motion. Actually, I'd argue that we can't help it: humans are naturally social and competitive. Whether it's motivated by prestige, fame, money, or simply self-satisfaction, it's both a curse and a blessing that most people are naturally driven to succeed and improve. Some are obviously more motivated than others (gender, upbringing, and wealth all factor into this), but I'd argue that most of us have stopped to consider the question, "Do I have what it takes to be the best?"

On the surface, this is a healthy process to go through. Mapping out a goal for one self, working hard at it, and either succeeding or failing is an important part of growing up. Through this process, one learns about their own strengths and weaknesses, and they gain valuable insight and experience that can be applied to future struggles.

But this drive to "be the best", especially when spurred on by parents, friends, and peers, can have drastic effects on one's personality and self-perception.

## The Idealized Self
During our struggles to be the best at something, we tend to make adaptations to help us achieve this goal. This usually means dedicating more time to practice, rehearse, or study. As a result, it also means making sacrifices so that more time and energy can be allocated towards that specific goal. This is necessary because there's only 24 hours in a day, and it's therefore impossible to simultaneously be the best chess-player, Fortnite player, guitar player, and programmer. Most disciplines require one's primary focus and attention in order to truly master it. 

As a result, aspiring for greatness usually means losing a part of oneself. As an exmaple, this could mean that an academic spends less time playing sports so that they can devote more time to their research. 

Additionally, in pursuit of greatness, many people (again, due to our inherent thirst for socialization and competition) often analyze other "great" people and attempt to mimic them. 

And as outsiders, what do we see when we analyze the professionals, the masters, and the inspired? We see someone who's dedicated, hard-working, passionate, and highly skilled. Someone who's devotion to their craft takes precedence over all other things. Doesn't that sound romantic? Doesn't that sound like something that *everyone* should strive to be?

Therefore, whether or not it truly reflects themselves, many people during this process tend to put themselves in a box, something conceived by society's assumptions and expectations of someone "great". **This process of boxing oneself in to match a preconceived notion of greatness is what leads to the creation of the "idealized self"**.

By "idealized self", I mean a perception of oneself that aligns with who we *want* to be. It's a compartmentalized aspect of our personality and consciousness that drives us to change who we are, presumably for the better. 

The idealized self can also fool us into thinking that we're someone that we're not. For example, an aspiring athlete might ask themselves, "would the greatest soccer player in the world take this night off to watch some silly japanese cartoons, or would they spend this night training and improving?" The idealized self is a powerful force, and can sometimes compel individuals to do things that they don't want to do. Under the guise of actual desire, the idealized self is driven by internal and external expectations of greatness.

## The Actual Self
Pursuing a realization of the idealized self isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it's often *required* to achieve greatness. Very, very few people end up being the best at something without hard work, intense focus, and countless sacrifices.

But anguish, anxiety, and dissonance can occur when this idealized self differs greatly from the "actual self": one's uninfluenced, unbiased, unemotional perception of oneself *in the present*. In contrast to how one imagines a more perfect version of oneself (i.e. the idealized self), the actual self is free from rational consciousness and pressure from who we *want* ourselves to be. 

Instead, the actual self is a representation of who we are and what we want *at this very moment*. I'd argue that it sits somewhere between instinct and rational consciousness. It's represented by the raw thrill one feels when engaging in something truly enjoyable, and also the cold indifference when engaging in something that's of no interest to them. It's a truer reflection of one's own wants, needs, and desires than the idealized self since the idealized self is often influenced by both internal *and* external factors (i.e. peer pressure, social expectations, etc). 

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="" :src="'/triangle.jpg'" />
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Not dissimilar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow's hierarchy of needs</a>, I'd argue that our instincts influence what we do and don't find enjoyable, which in turn influences how we want to channel our interests into something greater than what they are (i.e. being the best, changing the world, etc).</span>
</div>

## Ideal Versus Actual
As stated above, pursuing an idealized version of oneself in spite of their actual self isn't inherently an unhealthy decision. But when the idealized self and actual self are completely out of sync, individuals tend to struggle. To illustrate this, consider someone (i.e. myself) who had dreams of becoming a great musician. They had natural talent as a child, and had been encouraged by friends and family to take their skills to the next level.

But as obsessiveness began to take hold, the pressure to "be the best" began to overshadow everything else. Throughout the countless hours of practicing and performing, *music stopped being enjoyable*. But the idealized self had become so dominant that they had failed to realize this, and had started suppressing their true wants and desires. As a result, much of their music career was tainted by dread, anxiety, and boredom. In short, other parts of their personality and interests began to wane in order to pursue something that they *weren't actually interested in pursuing*. 

Therefore, for individuals like me, a divergent idealized self can have a two-fold negative effect: it drives an individual to engage in activities that they no longer enjoy, and it also comes at the expense of their other wants and desires. In other words, it's a massive waste of time and energy. 

Some may be able to bring their idealized self and actual self back in sync fairly easily, but for others, it can be very difficult: for myself, it took me ~15 years to realize that I didn't care enough about music to turn my dreams of greatness into reality. I had put myself into an idealized "musician" box and had accepted all that that entails without questioning if that truly reflected what I wanted and what my strengths were. 

The ease at which someone can bring their idealized and actual self back in sync depends upon many factors: personality, environment, upbringing, etc. But I'd argue that with the prevalence of social media and the internet, it's much easier to feel compelled to press on in spite of one's own desires and wants. I personally know of many friends and family members that have fallen into a dangerous pursuit of their idealized self at the expense of their actual self, and I have a feeling that it's a problem that will only get worse until people start rejecting social media.

## Bringing the Idealized and Actual Back in Sync
To get philosophical, I'd argue that it's not possible to keep our idealized self and actual self in sync 100% of the time. Our perception of ourselves is influenced by countless factors, and there's no such thing as a "constant" actual self: we are always changing and adapting to our environment, and our needs, wants, and interests aren't static.

For example, I may truly enjoy something today, but for a variety of reasons, I may not enjoy it tomorrow. But the simple act of recognizing my enjoyment of something and being conscious of of it can creative a narrative in one's head that becomes a part of how we perceive ourselves. "I am a person that likes XYZ" is a powerful, long-lasting concept that becomes difficult to shake, even when it no longer holds true. Once you've internalized that thought, it becomes another "box" that we're put ourselves in. Human beings love to categorize and label. It's a cost-saving mechanism that, for better or worse, helps us make decisions quickly about who someone is without having all of the information. But as a result, it's very easy to apply the categorization to ourselves, even when it isn't accurate.

Consider the diagram below, which outlines how an interest in something progresses over time.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="" :src="'/flow.jpg'" />
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">The actual self consists of things that you are genuinely interested in</span>
</div>

This cyclical graph is a natural process for most people: they take up an interest in something, and soon after, they then internalize that fact (i.e. "I am a person who likes XYZ" or "I'm a XYZ-er"). But over time, as their interest wanes or they experience setbacks, they'll be forced to re-evaluate their assumptions about this interest. At that point, that interest will either be affirmed or denied, and then the cycle continues. 

But many people like myself fall into the trap of "putting themselves" into a box by ignoring their actual self, and ignoring any sign that they might wish to live outside that box (i.e. me continuing to participate in music competitions for years despite having no genuine interest to improve). For some, their idealized self becomes so strong that they simply oscillate between the two boxes on the right, never realizing that their time and energy could be better spent elsewhere.


The only way to get *reasonably* close to knowing what you *truly* want in life is to ask yourself. Self-reflection is key, and I'd argue that it's beneficial to do it as much as possible. It took me ~15 years or so to realize that I did not have the skill or passion to become a great musician. While that's a lot of wasted time and effort, I'm glad that I finally realized it. As they say, "the best time to do something is 20 years ago. The second best time is now." 

You may be aware of a stereotype exists about older people that goes something like, "when you got older, you tend to abandon all of your hopes and dreams, and instead simply settle for mediocrity". While it's often perceived as a failure and something to pity, I'd argue that the opposite can be true: it's a frank recognition that one lacked the time, talent, or interest to achieve those dreams, which allows one to simply find something else that makes them happy. It's no coincidence that this realization usually occurs when one's brain has finished developing, and starts to think more rationally. 

At that point, instead of thinking emotionally and idealistically, one's thinking becomes more practical. It becomes something more along the lines of, "instead of struggling to meet some arbitrary measure of greatness, how do I maximize my happiness?" And while that may be depressing to some, it's absolutely liberating for others.

## Summary
With all of that said, would I recommend that absolutely *no one* pursue their lofty aspirations of greatness, and instead accept mediocrity as a consistent, normal part of life? *Of course not*. As I mentioned above, it's these same lofty aspirations that propel the human race forward. Without dreamers and big thinkers, I'd argue that our collective society would be much worse off.

But I *would* recommend staying in tune with yourself as much as possible, and to avoid putting yourself in a box. If you have a genuine passion for music, sports, or academics, and wish to change the world, then I'd whole-heartedly encourage you to pursue that dream. But at the same time, I'd recommend asking yourself frequently along your journey, "Am I having fun? Is this something that I truly enjoy doing?". Avoid putting yourself in a box, which puts pressure on you to conform to something that you aren't.

By being honest with yourself, you'll either give yourself motivation to press onwards, or you'll allow yourself the humility and grace to step down and pursue something else that makes you happy. Who knows? You might discover something about yourself that you didn't know before, something else that could be channeled to change the world for the better.
