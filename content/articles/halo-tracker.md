## FAQs
### Such slander! Where did you get this data?
Directly from 343's half-functioning, busted, stripped-of-its-funding API. If you have an issue with the data, following this link: https://support.halowaypoint.com/hc/en-us. I'm sure they'll get back to you!

### When does this get updated?
Every Wednesday night or thursday morning. The entire process is automated (i.e. gathering of data, posting to this site)

### What do the categories mean?
Hover over the "i" button for each category for an explanation

### Why is my data missing?
You need to make your xbox/microsoft data sharing setting "public" (or at the very least, share it with "friends" and friend PPMan). TODO: not sure how to do that yet, but you should be able to google it.

### This is stupid / toxic/ a bad idea.
I want suggestions! Please share them.
