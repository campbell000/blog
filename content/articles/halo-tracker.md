## The Stats
<HaloDataContainer></HaloDataContainer>

## FAQs
### Such slander! Where did you get this data?
Directly from 343's half-functioning, busted API. Complain to Microsoft, not to me.

### When does this get updated?
An automated process runs every Wednesday night to update this page.

### Do "off-cycle" games count towards the stats (i.e. socials, weekends, etc)?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Only games played during Halo Nightâ„¢, within regulation time windows, will affect your stats on this site.

### Why is my data missing?
You need to make your xbox/microsoft data sharing settings "public" (or friend PPMAN and set your settings to "Friends Only").

### What do the categories mean?
Hover over the "i" button for each category for an explanation.

### This is stupid / toxic / a bad idea.
I want suggestions! Please share them.
