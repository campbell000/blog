## The Stats
<HaloDataContainer></HaloDataContainer>

## FAQs
### Such slander! Where did you get this data?
Directly from 343's half-functioning, busted, stripped-of-its-funding API. Complain to Microsoft, not to me.

### When does this get updated?
An automated script runs every Wednesday night to update this page.

### Do "off-cycle" games count towards the stats (i.e. socials, weekends, etc)?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Only games played during regulation Halo Night count towards these stats.

### What do the categories mean?
Hover over the "i" button for each category for an explanation

### Why is my data missing?
You need to make your xbox/microsoft data sharing setting "public" (or at the very least, share it with "friends" and friend PPMan). TODO: not sure how to do that yet, but you should be able to google it.

### This is stupid / toxic/ a bad idea.
I want suggestions! Please share them.
