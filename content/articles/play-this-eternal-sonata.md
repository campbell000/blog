## Disclaimers
* **I'll be avoiding all spoilers in this post.**
* My opinions below aren't meant to serve as a full review for each game, so I may generalize for the sake of brevity.

## Introduction: a Tale of Two JRPGs
With a lack of notable RPG releases this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to tackle some of the games in my backlog that I had been meaning to get around to. In particular, I had been wanting to explore Japanese RPGs since that's a genre I usually ignore. I also narrowed down my search to games that had some form of co-op play: everyone knows that cheesy, over-the-top JRPGs are best enjoyed with a friend. Thankfully, my fiance (who is a sucker for anime melodrama and cliched romances) happily obliged.

My fiance had been itching to play **Tales of Symphonia**, an action-oriented JRPG for the Gamecube. Originally published by Bandai Namco in 2004, it's seen several re-releases since then: it was ported to the PS2, and then to the PS3 (bundled with it's sequel), and then finally to PC via Steam. We opted to play the PS3 re-release since it features additional content and upscaled graphics when compared to the original Gamecube version.

I, on the other hand, had a weird curiosity for **Eternal Sonata**, a JRPG for the Xbox 360 (and later PS3). This game was *also* published by Bandai Namco, and was released in 2007 (and later ported to the PS3 in 2008). We opted to play the PS3 version, since its considered to be an overall improvement to the original Xbox 360 version. 

So, what did we do? We played *both* of them, of course! What did we think of them? Read on to find out!

<accent-box>
One final point: you may object to my critiques with "these games were good at the time! You can't judge them by 2021 standards!", but I disagree. I certainly <i>can</i> judge them by 2021 standards. Just watch me! My intent with this post is to help readers answer the question, "Is this game fun?" rather than "Was this game fun in the year 2004?"

## *Tales of Symphonia*: Woefully Out of Tune
<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/symph.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Tales of Symphonia's battle system is fast and fun, but that's probably it's biggest (and only) strength. Image Credit: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rpgsite.net/review/3346-tales-of-symphonia-chronicles-review">RPGSite</a></span>
</div>

Let me set the stage: my fiance and I were absolutely *pumped* to play this game. It routinely ranks very highly on "Best Of Tales Series" lists such as [this one](https://www.thegamer.com/best-tales-games-ranked/), which claims that it's the 2nd best Tales game of all time. Having played other games on that list and loving them (warts included), my fiance and I were eager to get this Symphonic party started.

Having said that, we knew that we'd have to temper our expectations. The game *is* over 15 years old: game design, art, and graphics and dramatically improved since 2004, so we tried to keep that in mind as we played.

But despite our best attempts to play the game as if we were starry-eyed preteens in the 2000's, drinking our [Caprisuns](https://parents.caprisun.com/) and slurping our [yogurt through a tube](https://www.yoplait.com/product-category/gogurt/), the game never clicked with us. It took about 20 hours for my fiance and I to realize that we were wishing this game would hurry up and get itself over with. We *did* finish the game after 40 hours or so (as Tales fans, we felt that it was our *duty*), but I almost wish we hadn't.

This isn't to say that the game is irredeemable. It has its strengths, such as:
* It's fast, fluid, and fun real-time battle system (the Gamecube release runs at 60FPS, which feels awesome).
* The chemistry between the characters during cutscenes and random conversations ("skits" in Tales parlance).
* An interesting narrative premise (in theory)

But as a cohesive whole, the game is poorly designed, frustrating, and at times, disrespectful to the player. While I could spend a lot of time talking about the things I didn't like I'll narrow it down to one main critiques: **a linear experience with no hook**

"Linear" RPGs, or ones that restrict exploration and player freedom, get a bad rap in Western circles. We're used to huge, open-ended RPGs that actively encourage exploring and getting diverted off the main path (Elder Scrolls, Fallout, etc). As a result, we tend to complain when RPGs restrict our freedom. JRPGs, on the other hand, tend to be more-guided experiences (although this is changing).

I'd argue that linearity isn't necessarily a bad thing: many great games use linearity to craft memorable, focused experiences for the player. Halo, Call of Duty, God of War, Uncharted, Final Fantasy, and Paper Mario are all of examples of single-player experiences that don't allow for much unguided exploration, and are undoubtedly some of the greatest games ever made.

But for linear game designs to pay off, there needs to be a "hook". Whether that hook is gameplay (i.e. exciting action sequences), story-driven (i.e. cutscenes, major plot events), or something else, the game needs to be able to entice the player to go along with its linear structure. For example, it needs to convince the player that *they* want to search a forrest for the Master Sword, rather than simply tell the player, "you need to go to the forrest for the sword. Don't ask me why. You simply have to do it". When linear games fail to do this, they tend to start feeling like chores to play.

Despite its fun battle system, *Tales of Symphonia* lacks this hook. Presentation-wise, the game fails to tell a compelling story for a number of reasons:
* The game's premise is interesting, but its execution is an absolute mess. It tries to tackle themes of Sacrifice, Betrayal, Genocide, and Lineage, but fails to flesh any of these themes out. I won't attempt to summarize the game's story here because that would be impossible. There's simply too much going on.
* The game assaults new players with loads of Proper Nouns that don't mean anything to the player until the later half of the game.
* The game's voice-acted dialog ranges from inoffensive to painful. Characters are stiffly animated during cutscenes, or not even animated at all. More than 50% of the game's playtime will be spent pressing "A" to advance dialog, which makes this especially awful.
* The game's script is much too on-the-nose, and much of the dialog is incredibly awkward to hear. Characters *constantly* explain their thoughts, feelings, and motivations (violating the storytelling Golden Rule "Show, don't Tell"), and most of the game's villains are one-dimensional (if I have to hear "Inferior Beings" one more time...). None of the characters come off as believable or human.
* The game simply looks *OK*. The game's battles look great but the characters faces and models lack any emotion, which makes it difficult to truly empathize with them.

Okay, so the game fails to engage the player with its narrative. Fine, who cares. This is a "game"! Surely the game is fun to play?

Not exactly. As mentioned above, the battle system *is* fun in small sessions, but it collapses under the weight of the game's awful dungeon design, which consists of:
* Hoards of respawning enemies that usually pose little threat, making each battle boring and unrewarding.
* Unimaginative puzzles that you've already seen in a million other games. Sliding block puzzles, liquid-running-down-pipe puzzles, raise/lower water-level puzzles, you name it, it's here. None of them are fun.
* Dungeons require a hefty amount of back-tracking and are maze-like in design, which exacerbates the points above.
* You *will* be underleveled when you fight bosses for the first time, so make sure you put aside even *more* time for grinding.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/block.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Do you like sliding block puzzles? If so, then you're in luck! Tales of Symphonia is filled with unimaginative puzzles like this.</span>
</div>

All of this makes for a game that just *feels* tiring: its linear design shuttles you around between towns and dungeons, and both are absolute slogs to endure for a variety of reasons. Sometimes, the game will have you travel back and forth *and back again* between towns, which suspiciously starts to come off as the game padding itself so that it can claim "40 hours of gameplay!" on the back of the box, the player's precious time be damned.

With a lack of any compelling hook, the game becomes a chore to play. This is a shame because there seems to be lots of people that fell in love with this game. Maybe I'm missing something? Or maybe it's nostalgia, and I simply didn't drink enough Caprisuns while playing? I'll never know for sure.

**Nevertheless, my advice is:** don't play this game unless you want a history lesson in the *Tales Of* series. Doubly so if you've already played a game in the Tales franchise, as this game is objectively worse than the games that came after it (i.e. *Tales of Vesperia* or *Tales of the Abyss*). If you want to get into the Tales series, play those, instead. But do *not* play *Tales of Symphonia's* sequel, *Dawn of the New World*. It inherits *Symphonia's* problems while managing to introduce some of its own (that's a post for another day).

**My Rating:** 2 Inferior Beings out of 5

## Eternal Sonata: a Flawed, but Refreshing, Change of Tempo
<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/sonata.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">This game is far from perfect, but its presentation is absolutely beautiful at times.</span>
</div>

In contrast to *Symphonia's* dedicated following online, not many people seem to care for, or even remember, *Eternal Sonata*. Despite being a highly-anticipated game before its release, [the game received lukewarm reviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_Sonata#Reception). Since then, I've noticed that the game is rarely discussed in forums and news sites. In fact, none of our gaming friends had ever even *heard* of it. But despite being a little concerned about the game's battle system (which is more turn-based than not), I wanted to give this game a shot because it seemed *different*. 

For those who haven't heard of this game, the basic premise can be summarized as follows: Frederic Chopin, the brilliant piano composer (that actually existed in real life), is dying from Tuberculosis, and the entirety of the game takes place in his dreams as he lies on his deathbed. You play as a group of characters, including Chopin, that try to make sense of the fantastical and cruel world around them. Much like the game's premise, the game's presentation takes on a fantastical, ethereal look that is, at times, amazing to witness.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/forest.gif'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Despite its age, the game has a very-attractive storybook quality, which lends itself well to the game's dreamworld motif. Moments like this were enough to compensate for the game's so-so dungeon design</span>
</div>

It's an outrageous premise for a videogame, and to me, it seemed inevitable that this game would devolve into silliness and absurdity. But from the moment I started the game, I immediately noticed that the game's creators *weren't screwing around*: it's clear that a lot of care and diligence went into ensuring that this game was an adequate tribute to Chopin and his legacy. For starters, the developers actually [consulted the Frederic Chopin Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_Sonata#Development) to ensure that they were depicting a thematically-accurate representation of Chopin's life. 

The game also punctuates the end of each chapter with history lessons about the real Chopin's life, with his music accompanying static real-life imagery. While it sounds bizarre, it works surprisingly well, and is something that my fiance and I looked forward to at each chapter's conclusion. While it may not seem like it at first glance, these history lessons have subtle, yet interesting, connections to the game's storyline. Things like this make *Eternal Sonata* a little weird, but refreshingly different.

To be clear, though, the game is *not* biographical: real-life Chopin never led a zany cast of anime characters through a desert to find a magic crystal, nor could he bring monsters to their knees with a swing of his baton (Chopin was *not* a conductor), and Chopin likely never looked like a wispy anime boy band member. But that's not really the point.

Rather, the point of the game is about exploring Chopin's life, and how it says something about our own lives, what it means to live, and what it means to die. It speaks to the power of memories and legacies, all while using Chopin's music as an emotional amplifier. His music is saved for the heaviest moments, and they're utilized to great effect. 

Seriously, it's wild to me that this game, despite its flaws (which I'll get to in a sec), gets so many things *right:*
* **The Environments:** the game's landscapes and scenery are wonderful to look at. In an era where most games on the 360/PS3 were coated in drab, greyish-brown hues, *Eternal Sonata* uses color to great effect. 
* **The Character Animations:** the game's main characters move and emote very convincingly. Despite veering into [uncanny-valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley) territory at times, the characters' faces convey a *ton* of emotion. This helps the game mitigate its adequate, but sometimes uneven, voice work.
* **The Music:** as expected, the game's music is phenomenal. The game's final end-credits song stands out as one of the greatest pieces of videogame music I've ever heard.
* **The Sound:** forests creak and chirp with life, towns bustle underneath the whirring of windmills, and sewers drip and echo. When compared to a game like Symphonia, which features no ambient sounds or noise whatsoever, the difference is stark. Few games that I've played pay this much attention to ambient sound design.
* **The battle system:** The game's battle system is unique and enjoyable, for the most part. The Light/Shadow mechanic is particularly engaging (attacks have different effects when your player is cast in shadow).
* Without spoiling anything, the game's narrative isn't afraid to let the player think for themselves, unlike *Symphonia*, which beats its players over the head with what it wants you to think and feel.

  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Aside from some uncanny-valley-esque eye movements, the characters show a ton of emotion through their faces alone.</span>
</div>

Needless to say, this game absolutely nails its presentation. And it's refreshing to play a JRPG that doesn't relentlessly drill one-liners and "This is why I must" speeches into the player's ears. While not every second of *Eternal Sonata* is enjoyable, it was a wholly enjoyable experience that hasn't really been replicated in any other game. For that alone, I would recommend it.

*Eternal Sonata* is at its best when its free to flex its artistic muscles, but suffers from some of the same gameplay problems that *Symphonia* does. Its dungeon designs, for example, tend to be narrow, linear passages that force the player through enemies that spawn a *little* too often. This is compounded by the fact that, despite being enjoyable at face-value, the game's battles last a *little* too long. Symphonia fared better in this regard because of its real-time nature: there's no downtime when in battle, and makes the player feel engaged and entertained for its entirety. *Eternal Sonata*, on the other hand, forces you to sit through each enemy's turn, which can sometimes lead to waiting periods of over 30 seconds. This isn't a problem when the enemy encounter rate is manageable, but in dungeons, battles will probably start grating on the player's nerves.

Therefore, like Symphonia, *Eternal Sonata* dungeons are inconvenient at best and a time-consuming chore at worst (*Sonata's* puzzles are a little more interesting than *Symphonia's*, for what it's worth).

Also like *Symphonia*, *Eternal Sonata's* dialog is a little wonky. Lines that may have been fine to read sound very stilted and unnatural when spoken out loud by voice actors that sometimes struggle to convey the appropriate tone. Like many other RPGs, this may be due to a sub-par, low-budget localization from Japanese, but regardless of the reason, the game's script could have been improved. 

But unlike Symphonia, despite *Eternal Sonata* being extremely linear, perhaps even more linear than *Symphonia*, *Eternal Sonata* has a "hook": I was eager to power through dungeons so that I could experience more of the game's presentation: the Chopin history lessons, the game's landscapes and vistas, the entertaining cutscenes and animations, and the wonderful overworld music were significant enough motivators for me to power through the game's weaker moments. And to be clear, the game's battle system *is* fun: I enjoyed leveling up and unlocking new abilities for each of the game's characters, and was eager to try them out in battle. The novelty simply starts to wear off, however, during extended play sessions as you get into more and more battles.

But again, the rest of the game was so entertaining that it didn't really matter to me in the end. Unlike *Symphonia*, which I begrudgingly finished, I felt a sense of relief, gratitude, and sadness that the experience was over. I don't mean to say that I wish the game was *longer*: it was neither too short or too long. Rather, I felt an odd mixture of loss and life. Sad at the confusing, cruel nature of our world, but invigorated by the wonderful things that its people can create.

Chopin's "Raindrop" is one of his real-life pieces that is featured in <i>Eternal Sonata</i>. It's a beautiful piece, and used to great effect.

Before I get ahead of myself and call *Eternal Sonata* a masterpiece, I'll leave at this: it's a game that deserves to be played *despite* its flaws. You may not appreciate its art and music as much as me, but you owe it to yourself to give it a shot if you're looking for something different.

**My Rating:** 4 Creepy but Beautiful Anime Eyes out of 5.
