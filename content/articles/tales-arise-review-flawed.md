## Disclaimers
* I will keep plot-specific spoilers to a minimum, but beware: **this post will contain spoilers.**
* I completed the entire game on the "Hard" difficulty. I also completed most of the post-game content. Beating the main game (with lots of sidequests) took me about 60 hours, while the post-game content took me about 10-15 hours.
* I played the game on the Xbox Series X. I also got to witness first-hand how the game runs on PS4 (my wife was playing it alongside me).

## Introduction: Setting the Stage
*Tales Of Arise* is the latest entry in the long-running *Tales Of* series. Developed and published by Bandai Namco, *Arise* was pitched early on as a much-needed upgrade for the series. The last two entries, *Tales of Zestiria* (2015) and *Tales Of Berseria* (2017), both received criticism at the time for looking and feeling distinctly last-gen. Both games were simultaneously released for the PS3 *and* PS4, and next to games like *Uncharted 4* (2016), the *Tales Of* series started to feel stale.

In response to that criticism, the development team migrated the series to Unreal Engine 4 and promised to give *Arise* a much needed facelift, among other things: higher production values, a more-open world (but not necessarily "open world"), and an evolution of the game's core mechanics to appeal to new *and* old fans of the series.

How well did Bandai Namco stick to their promises? Having spent 90+ hours in the world of *Arise*, I think I\'m in a good spot to answer that question. But in order to properly summarize those 90 hours, this review may get a little long: I want to praise Bandai Namco for taking a giant leap forward, as well as criticize them for taking several steps back.

Without further ado, let's get this anime JRPG party started!

## The Good Stuff

  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary"><i>Arise</i> makes a great first impression. Image Credit: <a target="_blank" href="https://gamerant.com/every-tales-of-arise-trailer-explained/">Game Rant</a></span>
</div>

Credit where credit is due: *Arise* makes a fantastic first impression. The game's visual presentation, and especially the use of its ["Atmospheric Shader"](https://noisypixel.net/tales-of-arise-more-mature-story-digital-edition/), is excellent: the environments and particle effects have a realistic, yet fantastical, quality to them. I was initially concerned that the game\'s use of Unreal Engine 4 would make the game lose its signature watercolor style, but I think *Arise's* developers found a great middle ground between overly-cartoony and boring.

Character animations during battle are also an amazing sight to behold: they swing, punch, cast, and slam with a surprising amount of heft. Special moves are flashy and entertaining, even after the 100th time you've seen them. Flame and lightening effect punctuate duo-attacks (called "Boost Strikes"), and despite being a little dizzying at times, the game's battles are a fantastic spectacle.

Thankfully, despite being flashy and overwhelming at times, the game maintains a rock-steady 60 frames-per-second for the majority of my playthrough (assuming you're on PS5 or Series X, and you've turned on "Performance Mode", as opposed to "Quality Mode", which struggles to maintain its framerate). Major props to the development team for this achievement in an era where most games struggle to maintain 30 FPS.

Narrative-wise, the game's first several hours are also impressive. Rather than spending its first couple hours in a boring, idyllic town like most JRPGs (and even past games in the series), *Arise* gets straight to the point: it begins with a harrowing scene of slaves being tortured and mistreated, followed by a mysterious, high-octane chase involving one of the game\'s main female protagonists, Shionne. With liberal use of gorgeously-produced anime cutscenes and a booming orchestral score, the game's opening act forces players to recognize that *Arise* is not like other *Tales Of* games. It seems to say, "I'm bigger and better, so you'd better buckle up".

While the story progresses in a predictable way (i.e. "There are 4 bad guys we need to take down so we can take their power crystals"), its little twists and turns along the way were enough to keep me engaged.

The game's visual and narrative upgrades are accompanied by a stellar voice cast. Likely exacerbated by English localizations often being a secondary concern, many JRPGs tend to suffer from poor voice direction: chirpy and over-enthusiastic at best, and cringe-inducing at worst. Thankfully, *Arise* avoids this trend with mature, professional-sounding voice acting. That's not to say that it doesn't have its fair share of anime-induced silliness, but I did appreciate the game's shift to a slightly more serious tone.

  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">The game's frantic and frenzied real-time battle system is great fun, albeit in moderately-sized doses. Image Credit: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-arise-preview">Rock Paper Shotgun</a></span>
</div>

The (arguably) most important element of the *Tales Of* series, however, is its real-time battle system, and I'm happy to report that it does not disappoint. It's *fast* and (in moderate amounts) very enjoyable.

In a nod to long-time fans of the series, the battle system returns to its roots of having two types of attacks: normal attacks and special attacks called "Artes" (the latter consumes resources so they cannot be spammed). The combo system rewards players for alternating between these two types of attacks to extend combos, and experimenting with different Artes and abilities to keep these combo-chains going was a lot of fun. The game is a *little* more punishing than other Tales games because most special moves put your player into a vulnerable position before attacking, and unlike other games in the series, Artes *cannot* be canceled if you mistakenly leave yourself open to attack. While annoying at first, I ended up appreciating this decision decision, as it made me think a little more carefully and strategically.

To keep things fresh, extra skills and extra Artes are unlocked along the way, and some Artes can only be earned by using another Arte a certain number of times. This forces players to mix and match Artes (since you can only equip several at a time), encouraging experimentation and thinking outside of the box. In addition, if you get bored of using Alphen, the game's vanilla swordsman, there are 5 other characters you can choose from, which all play very differently from one another. I found myself switching from Alphen to Law (fists) to Rinwell (mage) to Shionne (guns) on a regular basis.

All in all, *Arise* seriously impresses right out of the gate, and smartly doles out small changes as the game progresses to keep things interesting.

## The Bad Stuff
<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/toa_talk.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">You'll spend a lot of time mostly listening to (but sometimes) reading dialog, which ranges from entertaining to mind-numbing.</span>
</div>

Despite the game's very strong opening, certain problems begin to emerge as the game progresses. Character dialog begins to bore. Side quests become rote and uninteresting. The story and its progression becomes predictable as you enter the 2nd or 3rd zone. In general, after about 10 to 20 hours, the game's Triple-A facade starts to wear away.

That's not to say that the game absolutely falls apart after 10 or 20 hours (that actually happens a little later, which I'll get to in the next section), but cracks begin to show. To keep it brief, below is a list of issues that, while aren't dealbreakers, were disappointing to uncover, especially since the beginning of the game hides them so well:

- The grand, booming orchestral arrangement in the game's first zone is disappointingly re-used across the game's four main zones. It's ill-suited for the other zones and begins to grate. In general, after around 10 hours, you'll start to notice that the music all starts to sound the same, with very few standout tracks.
- The vast, open-world vistas that were teased in the game's trailers and cutscenes are surprisingly small and restrictive. There's far too many invisible walls. Breath of the Wild, this ain't. Landscapes that are supposed to feel open and free end up feeling like narrow corridors with pretty backdrops.
- There's *very* literal enemy variety. There literally 6-10 enemy types (excluding bosses) in the entire game, and they're simply reskinned and re-colored as you progress. Their movements and patterns are the same across all 4 zones.
- 2D anime-inspired skits from <a target="_blank" href="/toa_skit_prev.jpeg">previous tales games</a> are replaced with a 3D-animated comic-book style that re-uses character models. In my opinion, the faces of *Arise's* models lack emotion and seem too robotic, while the 2D faces of earlier games are brimming with personality. Therefore, this is a downgrade in my book.
- The crafting system (it's 2021, so of *course* this game has a crafting system) is *fine*. The fishing (ditto) minigames are *fine*. The cooking system is *fine*. While OK in short bursts, these systems add very little to the overall enjoyment of the game. I found myself skipping fishing and cooking entirely.
- Side quests range from mildly interesting at best, to disposable at worst. Most sidequests lack voice acting, and the rewards are usually inconsequential, appealing only to those looking to aggressively optimize their stats (which is definitely not required if you're playing on Normal or Hard).
- While this didn't affect *my* playthrough, I feel the need to say this: the game runs very poorly on "last-gen" consoles (i.e. the PS4). The game's framerate is unlocked, which means it varies wildly: it hovers around 40-50fps in battles, but can dip as low as 15-20fps. Given that Xbox Series X's and PS5's are hard to come by, I would definitely recommend waiting until you can acquire a new console before playing this game.
- Cool-looking character skins and paid-for DLC is dangled in front of you every time you rest at a camp fire. For a series that *used* to include these same cool and silly costumes for free, it comes off as manipulative and slimy. Yes, all big-budget games utilize manipulative tactics like this, but that doesn't make it OK.

</div>

My recommendation for readers would be to briefly glance over the bullet-point list above to see if any of these are deal-breakers. If so, then you may as well stop reading. But if not, I recommending continuing to read because I have yet to scratch the surface as to the *major* problems that this game has.

## The Ugly Stuff
Aside from the issues mentioned above, it was around the 25-hour mark that my wide-eyed optimism turned into disdain. I'll refrain from going into the story-related events that cause this major shift, but both narratively and mechanically, the game takes a drastic turn for the worse once all of the magic crystal power gems are collected.

Curiously, many of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-arise-review">mostly</a>-<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tales-of-arise-review-wake-me-up-inside/1900-6417727/">positive</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/tales-of-arise-the-kotaku-review-1847682321">reviews</a> online don't mention this problematic shift at all. The obvious conclusion is that, [like always](https://www.denofgeek.com/games/days-gone-actor-sam-witwer-reviews-journalists-controversy/), these reviewers likely didn't bother to finish the game, and their mostly-positive sentiments can be attributed to the fact they *believed* that the game was basically over once all of the magic macguffins were collected, despite that *not* being the case (for example, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/tales-of-arise-the-kotaku-review-1847682321">Kotaku.com</a> review admits outright that they hadn't finished the game). As usual, big-budget videogame journalists failed to do their jobs.

So, what *exactly* goes wrong around the 30-hour mark? Read on to find out.

### Major Issue #1: Battle System Dissonance
*Arise's* battle system is heavily centered around combos: when you successfully land an attack on an enemy, it is briefly stunned, which allows for you to safely follow up with another attack. Special duo-attacks allow you to extend your combo even further, which makes it fun to strategize your attack plan around using these duo-attacks at the perfect time. Knocking enemies in the air allows you to continue your combos even further, which increases the amount of options that a player has for extending their combos.

In addition, the game goes out of its way to explain that stringing hits together between you and your party members increases damage output, increases XP, and increases the likelihood of rare item drops. To drive home that point, the game keeps a static combo counter on the screen to remind you of this, taunting you to drive that number as high as you can. Combos have always been a fun and rewarding part of *Tales* games, and *Arise* is no exception: the game clearly emphasizes that combo'ing enemies is how this game is meant to be played and enjoyed.

But for inexplicable reasons, minibosses (big monster-type overworld enemies) and bosses (human-type special encounters) do not get stunned when hit. Therefore, they simply *cannot* be combo'd. 

Instead, boss battles require you to simply spam 2 to 4 hits and run away, repeating this process 50-100 times until the enemy is dead. All of the time you've spent thus far optimizing your strategies and Artes selection for maximum combo potential gets thrown out the window as you're forced to reckon with enemies that can't be staggered or stunned. If you get greedy with the number of hits, you'll end up getting smacked. In fact, certain *Artes* with exceptionally long startup times are simply unsafe to use in boss battles, *period*.

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/toa_ganna.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Boss battles are supposed to be fun, while also testing you on what you've learned so far. In <i>Arise</i>, however, these battles are tedious and frustrating experiences.</span>
</div>

And as one would expect, tickling the enemy for 5 seconds and then running away is immensely boring and time-consuming. Sure, the game tries to mix it up by throwing in some quick time events and some flashy mid-battle animations, but they do very little to alleviate the frustration and monotony of these battles. It's incredibly odd to me that, for a game that heavily emphasizes its combo system, it's baffling that (for the most part), minibosses and bosses cannot be combo'd at all.

At this point, you may be asking, "Why is this a big deal? Aren't boss battles a mere fraction of the game's overall length?". And if this were a normal JRPG, you'd be right: these boss battles wouldn't significantly damage the overall experience.

But in *Arise*, something awful happens at the 30-hour mark: minibosses start becoming regular overworld enemies. I assume that the developers did this to mitigate the lack of regular overworld enemy variety (mentioned above), but unfortunately, this decision has a catastrophically negative effect: the combo system, which is what makes the game fun and rewarding, stops mattering. Instead, the awful, tedious, mind-numbing strategy of hit-and-run becomes the norm. At this point in the game, I found myself wanting to avoid battles *at all costs* due to how boring and *long* they became.

Worse still, after around 40 hours or so, the game's overworld becomes *nothing but minibosses*. There is an *exceptionally* awful stretch at the end of the game where you will face *multiple* minibosses at the same time over the course of 3-4 hours. I don't know how the designers could look at the last 20 hours of the game and say with a straight face, "yep, the player is really gonna enjoy this". It feels lame, cheap, and artificially long (one of the 7 deadly sins of JRPGs is extending a game's length via frustrating and repetitive means).

In summary, the game's fun and frantic battle system absolutely crumbles under the weight of these lengthy, monotonous miniboss/boss battles. It's quite a shame because, underneath the bloat and repetition, there is a great battle system in *Arise's* core. But the best battle system in the world can't redeem the utter tedium of this game's latter half.

### Major Issue #2: a Bloated, Repetitive Script
I think this next issue is best illustrated via an example. If you'd rather watch it for yourself, watch the vid below (it starts at 3:00, which is really all you need to see to understand my point):

<youtube-link :src-link="'https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SVP96H_mQWk?start=180'">
A great cutscene showing how vulnerable and broken Shionne is.
</youtube-link>

But for those that would rather read text, consider a cutscene like the following:

- Alphen and Shionne, the male and female lead protagonists, just got through a harrowing experience.
- They bicker for a bit before opening up to each other in a refreshing way.
- Alphne momentarily turns his back to Shionne.
- With his back turned, Shionne longingly reaches out to touch him.
- Right before Alphen turns around, Shionne quickly and reluctantly pulls her arm back towards herself with a despondent look on her face.

Seriously, *this is a great cutscene*. It says so much about how Shionne feels without actually saying anything: through her actions and her gestures, you can clearly tell that she's *desperate* for human contact, and just wants to hold someone in a time of vulnerability and anxiety. But because of her condition (she hurts anyone she touches), as well as an emotional inability to open up, she forces herself to remain stoic and detached. All of this can be gathered from watching 20 seconds of the cutscene above.

In other words, this scene nails the Golden Rule of storytelling: [Show, Don't Tell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show,_don%27t_tell). It's much more satisfying to let viewers come to their own conclusions about characters, rather than being told through narration.

So, why bring this up? What's the problem with this game's script?

The problem is that, after this cutscene, you get *bombarded* with repetitive, clinical explanations as to how Shionne feels and what Shionne is thinking. The game discards all of the subtlety and nuance portrayed in this cutscene, and proceeds to tell you about Shionne over and over and over again. Throughout the rest of the game, you'll hear "Shionne is struggling because she longs for human touch, but her thorns are keeping her away" 50 different times, from a bunch of different characters. It's mind numbing and rather insulting, as it suggests that you, the viewer, weren't smart enough to pick this up yourself from the cutscene above. Instead, like a little schoolchild, the game beats you over the head with what it wants you to think and feel.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/toa_skit.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">These optional scenes, called "Skits", are awkwardly animated and contain disposable, repetitive dialog. Skip them.</span>
</div>

It's not just Shionne's feelings, either: characters blather on repetitively about *many* different topics, such as the difference between the two warring civilizations (Dhana and Rena), the motivations of the game's heros and villains, what it means to be a slave and what it means to be free, etc, etc, etc. These topics *are* interesting, but *Arise's* infantile, repetitive riffing on these topics will make most viewers' eyes glaze over as they hear, for the 20th time, what it means to be a free man amongst slaves. I, myself, started to skip dialog completely towards the end of the game (a point where, you know, dialog should start getting really important).

In addition, the way that the characters talk about these concepts are lifeless and robotic. Prior *Tales* games were interesting because characters would often fight and disagree about these things. It was fun to watch them bicker and banter with each other in realistic and natural ways. But in Arise, characters don't argue about these things. They don't have different viewpoints. They don't even bother to debate, just for the fun of it (save for small, isolated moments of levity. These scenes were great, but were *far* outnumbered by the rest of the game's script).

Instead, characters ramble in stilted, forced monologues, as if they were speaking directly to the player instead of another human being. For any given monologue-driven cutscene, you could probably randomize the order in which each character talks, and it wouldn't change the cutscene in any meaningful way. It's as if the script writers took one big monologue, cut it up into parts, and gave each part to a different voice actor. It's absolutely unbearable. And it's especially disappointing because this is one thing that *Tales* games typically do well. So it sucks to see *Arise* struggle to craft meaningful interactions between its characters

This is compounded by the fact that, from the beginning to the end, *Arise* subjects it players to these repetitive dialogues over and over and over again. Like most JRPGs, *Arise* is dialog and cutscene heavy, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But it becomes an *awful* thing because of how uninteresting the dialog is: you'll be hearing the same multi-part speeches repeatedly until the credits roll. If you were to remove these scenes from the game, *Arise* would lose about 20 hours and be all the better for it. The only explanation I can think of for the blandness and repetitiveness of this game's dialog is to artificially pad out its runtime.

### Major Issue #3: Disrespecting the Player's Time
Given the points above (long, tedious boss battles that get more plentiful and a bloated script), it really feels like *Arise* isn't respectful of the fact that we all have a limited amount of time on this beautiful, broken planet of ours. It seems content to take 20-30 hours of actual game and stretch it to its absolute limits in order to make it 50-60 hours.

Take its dungeons for example: *Tales* games typically have awful dungeons ([I've mentioned that in the past](https://nevermeant.dev/play-this-eternal-sonata)), but given *Arise's* promise of being an evolution of the series, I was hopeful it would turn things around. Instead, its dungeons are perhaps the worst that the series has ever had: they consist of nothing but narrow corridors, elevators, and room keys. The general pattern is: traverse a floor, go all the way to the end, discover that the path forward requires a magic key, backtrack into all of the rooms (which have respawned enemies by this point), find the key, and continue forward. Repeat this 1-3 times, fight a boss, and the dungeon is over. That's it.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/toa_map.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Every big square on this map contains multiple minibosses. There are about 10 floors in this dungeon. Excited yet?</span>
</div>

Especially egregious are the last two dungeons. For reasons unknown, the 2nd-to-last doesn't allow fast-travel *at all*, which means walking back *the way you came* once you beat it. Oh, and of course, the enemies have all respawned. The last dungeon also doesn't allow fast travel until you've reached the very end. So if you die midway through this multi-hour dungeon, you'll have to start all over again. Did I mention this dungeon is multiple hours long?

Or how about the game's boss-based sidequests? Each one features minibosses that you've mostly seen before, except they've been supercharged with higher damage output and *much* more health. It's no exaggeration to say that these types of sidequests take over 10 minutes to complete (assuming that you beat it on your first try).

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/toa_tower.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">A tower that consists solely of a spiraling staircase upwards to fight a boss. It takes literally over a minute to get to the top. The characters even comment on how long and boring of a climb it is.</span>
</div>

The game isn't even *hard* (and I even beat it on "Hard* mode): it's simply a test of patience and the will continue in the face of monotony. Sure, you can crank the difficulty down a couple of notches and breeze through this game (something I was tempted to do), but that doesn't take away from the fact that this game is *filled* to the brim with repetition and filler. It's as if they had "Make Game 60+ hours long" as a hardline requirement from day 1, but failed to make the content to justify such a length.

Given its repetition, it's especially odd to see it cram about 30 minutes of story exposition at the end of the game. *Arise* was perfectly content with taking its time during inconsequential dungeons and sidequests, but when the story takes a drastic turn, all of the sudden the game feels the need to simply plop the player down and hurridly explain game's true conflict. I won't spoil it here, but the Big Reveal *was* cool to learn about, but it was done in such a haphazard way that I wasn't affected by its enormity in the slightest.

## Summary
For a game that strikes all the right notes in its opening hours, it's incredibly disappointing to see it stumble and sputter across the finish line. If I had to guess what went wrong, I'd assume that it's a combination of the following:

- Our dear friend COVID-19 making life a living hell for the game's designers and developers. According to Japanese culture experts, Japan was [especially unprepared](https://www.nippon.com/en/in-depth/a07602/) for the shift to work-from-home.
- The shift from a familiar (albeit dated) in-house engine to Unreal Engine 4. This likely introduced growing pains and inefficiencies in *Arise's* development.
- More than ever, games are *really* expensive to make.
- JRPG gamers' expectations that RPGs are worthless unless they are 40+ hours long. It's a misguided judge of quality, but especially for JRPGs, many gamers will not consider games under this arbitrary length.

Perhaps the most redeeming quality of *Arise* is in its promise for future *Tales Of* games: *Arise's* aesthetics are superb, its voice actors are supremely talented, the battle system is great fun (until you get to the miniboss shift described above), and the story's core concepts are thought-provoking. With these strong foundations, I can easily see Bandai Namco leveraging the great work that they've already done and improving upon *Arise's* failures to create an even-better successor. 

To be clear, I'm a huge fan of the *Tales of* series: there's nothing I want more than to see the series succeed on a worldwide scale. There's great potential in a sequel (spiritual or otherwise) to *Arise*, and I will be very eager to see what Bandai Namco does next with the series.

But on its own, *Arise* fails to live up to its "Triple A, Big Budget" premise. Here's hoping that *Tales of Arise 2: the Arise-ening* turns out a bit better than its predecessor.

**Verdict: 2 Lengthy Monologues Out of 5**
