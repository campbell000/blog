## Disclaimers
* This post will avoid all story spoilers, but I'll likely discuss some gameplay mechanics that get introduced as the player progresses.
* I completed the entire game on the "Hard/Classic" difficulty, which took me about 60 hours. I *hate* grinding, so I spent very little time with many of the game's outside-of-battle mechanics.
* I've played about 5 *Fire Emblem* games. I'm no hardcore series veteran, but I know my way around the weapon triangle.

## Context
<info-box :source-name="'Every Game Reviewer in 2023'" :source-link="'https://opencritic.com/game/13896/fire-emblem-engage'">
The story and characters suck, but the gameplay is amazing. Three House's social elements were a waste of time, so less of that is also good. 8/10.

Given that this is, pretty much, the universally-held opinion of everyone online about *Fire Emblem: Engage*, why write a review almost a year after the game's release date? Hasn't everything that one could possible say about this game already been said?

Not quite, dear reader. Not quite. Never one for broad-brush generalizations, I don't think that this sentiment adequately captures what *Engage* does right, as well as what it does wrong.

I've been a fan of the series since Awakening (I can hear LynLover69 physically cringing), but I've played many *Fire Emblem* titles since then. In order of preference, I've also played *Conquest* (3DS), *Echoes: Shadows of Valentia* (3DS, remake of an NES game), and *Sacred Stones* (GBA). I fell in love with the series' unforgiving, calculated gameplay, and *Engage* came out at a time when I wanted more.

In addition, I skipped *Three Houses* (*Engage's* predecessor) due to its reputation for being bloated with silly JRPG social/dating nonsense (I watched in agony as my wife spent countless hours trying maximize social links between party members), and *Engage* had been reported by many reviewers to be a much-welcomed course correction.

So, after managing to bring all of my units safely to the finish line (despite being very close to sacrificing Bunet, or "[Chef Pour-Are-Dee](http://www.hrwiki.org/wiki/Senor_Cardgage)" as my wife disaffectionately called him), what did I Think of *Engage*?

It was fun.
