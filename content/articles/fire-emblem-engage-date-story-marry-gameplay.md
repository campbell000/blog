## Disclaimers
* This post will avoid all story spoilers, but I'll likely discuss some gameplay mechanics that get introduced as the player progresses.
* I completed the entire game on the "Hard/Classic" difficulty, which took me about 60 hours. I *hate* grinding, so I spent very little time with many of the game's outside-of-battle mechanics.
* I've played about 5 *Fire Emblem* games. I'm no hardcore series veteran, but I know my way around the weapon triangle.

## Context
<info-box :source-name="'Every Game Reviewer in 2023'" :source-link="'https://opencritic.com/game/13896/fire-emblem-engage'">
The story and characters suck, but the gameplay is amazing. Three House's social elements were a waste of time, so less of that is also good. 8/10.
</info-box>

Given that this is, pretty much, the universally-held opinion of everyone online about *Fire Emblem: Engage*, why write a review almost a year after the game's release date? Hasn't everything that one could possible say about this game already been said?

Not quite, in my opinion. Never one for broad-brush generalizations, I think that lots of the discourse surrounding this game leaves out a lot of juicy details that people might otherwise be interested in. So, in this review, I'll try to focus on aspects of *Engage* that I think weren't talked about enough, but warrant further discussion.

I've been a fan of the series since Awakening (I can hear "LynLover69" physically cringing), but I've played many *Fire Emblem* titles since then. In order of preference, I've also played *Conquest* and its DLC campaign (3DS), *Echoes: Shadows of Valentia* (3DS, remake of an NES game), and *Sacred Stones* (GBA). I fell in love with the series' unforgiving, calculated gameplay, and *Engage* came out at a time when I wanted more.

I actually skipped *Three Houses* (*Engage's* predecessor) due to its reputation for being bloated with silly JRPG social/dating nonsense (I watched in agony as my wife spent countless hours trying maximize social links between party members). *Engage* had been reported by many reviewers to be a much-welcomed course correction from *Three Houses*, so I was eager to give it a go.

So, after managing to bring all of my units safely to the finish line (despite being tempted to offer Bunet as my sacrificial lamb), what did I Think of *Engage*?

## The Good Stuff
### Presentation
<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/fecolor.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">Say what you want about the character designs, but there's no denying that <i>Engage's</i> art style can be striking at times. <a src="https://serenesforest.net/2022/11/29/fire-emblem-engage-emblem-celica-analysis/">Image Credit</a></span>
</div>

Listen: I hate silly anime designs as much as the next guy. When screenshots of this game first came out, fans of the series starting disaffectionately referring to the main character as "[Toothpaste-chan](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/alear-toothpaste-chan)", and I can't say that I disagree; his/her design *is* ridiculous (and the female version's tie-between-the-boobs look is just...so...stupid).

But despite this, I'll admit that I *really* like *Engage's* art style. It brings a brightness and energy that helps keeps things visually appealing, which is important since some players (like myself) may find themselves starting at the screen for minutes at a time, pondering their next move.

I'd argue that Engage doesn't use bright colors randomly; for as chaotic as *Engage* can be, there is a consistency to its design and color use. It's use of neon blue blends contrasts excellently with the various pinks, greens, and yellows (and of course, matches the [hair color](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KqF9G_DQls) of almost every character in the game), and despite being few in number, its pre-rendered cutscenes can be a joy to look at.

And, as expected from any mainline Nintendo game, *Engage's* music is simply phenomenal (exlcuding its <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Attention anime/videogame composers: instrumental melodies are NOT interchangable with lyrical melodies! A melody that sounds great when played on a guitar will NOT NECESSARILY sound great when sung!'">terrible opening theme</text-with-tooltip>). Again, this serves not only an aesthetic purpose, but a functional one: I couldn't help but move and groove during my calculations on the battlefield, which helps alleviate the occasional tedium while waiting for enemies to move, or battle animations to finish.

<youtube-link :src-link="'https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j3UmYT3fSic?si=nlIE8Kv2wvKbqcLs'">This song's use of <i>Fire Emblem's</i> main theme is simply to <i>die</i> for. And that theremin! Such an odd, yet unique, choice.</youtube-link>

I also have to mention that (again, aside from a few stinkers like the main male protagonist) there are some *steller* voice acting performances in this game. Goldmary, Ivy, and Yunaka stand out as a joy to listen to.

Put simply, this is *by far* the best looking and best sounding *Fire Emblem* game to date. 

### Gameplay
Yes, I said that I was going to touch on aspects that *weren't* talked about to death, but it bears repeating that the moment-to-moment gameplay during battles is peak *Fire Emblem*. For those that aren't familiar with *Fire Emblem*, the gameplay premise is pretty simple: players must use their "chess pieces", each with their own abilities, strengths, and weaknesses, to defeat opponents on a grid-like board. 

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/fegameplay.jpg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">Thinking several moves ahead (again, like Chess) will prove vital in ensuring that all of a player's units survive. <a src="https://www.eurogamer.net/fire-emblem-engage-is-a-proud-celebration-of-all-that-came-before-it">Image Credit</a></span>
</div>

In my opinion, *Fire Emblem* is at its best when it feels like you're playing *chess*, rather than a typical RPG. Sure, stats, EXP, and character progression can be compelling features that encourage player freedom and choice, but they can also disrupt a game's balance. Being overleveled (either on purpose or by accident) tends to trivialize the strategy experience, while being *under*leveled tends to force players to waste time by grinding and/or engaging in silly minigames solely to boost stats. 

Put another way, I'd rather win a battle of *wits*, rather than a battle of *patience and time*.

In this sense, I'm happy to report that *Engage* gives me what I was looking for: despite playing on Hard mode, I was able to complete the game without any grinding or abuse of its systems whatsoever, with it still providing a decent challenge. Sure, the options to overlevel one's units are there for players that are looking for an easier or simpler experience, but if one is paying attention, *Engage* gives players everything they need to exceed *without* demanding that they waste their precious time <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Some people online have complained that Engage doesn\'t give you enough crafting materials or gold, but I think they\'re missing the point: the game is fun precisely BECAUSE you have to make hard decisions about resource allocation.'">grinding for experience or items</text-with-tooltip>.

I think *Engage's* strategic gameplay excels partly because of the re-introduction (with a subtle twist) of the series' classic <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Swords beat axes, axes beat lances, and lances Beat swords. Oh, and mages\' weakness is PUNCHING.'">"weapon triangle"</text-with-tooltip>. Sorely missing from *Three Houses*, the weapon triangle gives each unit a clear role to nestle into: archers are great for keeping flying enemies at bay, mages obliterate otherwise-formidable armored units, and good ole' fists can be used to punch mages in their stupid, conceited faces. Rather than simply picking one's highest-level units, the weapon triangle forces players to survey the battlefield before deploying to determine which units might work best for the situation at hand.

This ties into other reason that *Engage's* gameplay excels: there are *so many* tools at the player's disposal that they can leverage, and this is, in part, thanks to the game's ingenious <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'When given special items, your units can temporarily boost their stats and abilities, which can be enough to bring back a battle from the brink of defeat'">"Emblem system"</text-with-tooltip>. There are many, many ways in which players can distribute their emblem rings, with each ring having class-dependent effects on its recipient.

Want to temporarily give your healing mage +5 range? Want to spawn giant ice pillar blockades to give your units time to heal? What about an ability that draws enemies in for one turn, culminating in a huge multi-space explosion on the next turn? The Emblem system makes this, and more, possible.

While initially overwhelming, this system smartly encourages player experimentation and creativity, leading to endless strategic possibilities. For example, one of my favorite moments with *Engage* was when I concocted a hair-brained strategy that hinged upon using <span class="spoiler">Veyle</span> and Micaiah to launch Timerra and Ike half-way across the map, and the payoff when it actually *worked* was incredible. 

Even *more* interesting is that enemies can use these emblems and their abilities, too. I'll admit that the Emblems seemed a little *too* overpowered in *Engage's* first half, but proved to be absolutely essential in the second half in order to contend with enemies using these same tools against you.

In summary: *Engage* is a strategy game, first and foremost. Past the anime cringe, threadbare story, and sleep-inducing downtime between battles (all of which I'll get to below), the game is a masterclass in addictive, thoughtful, and flexible strategy game design. For that reason alone, I'd recommend it both to newcomers to the genre *and* fans of the series that haven't played it yet.

## The Bad Stuff
Despite my praise, the game makes some bafflingly annoying decisions that significantly detract from the experience. They aren't dealbreakers, so instead of spending paragraphs on each one, I'll briefly touch on each point:

* The characters with the most lines of dialog in this game are unfortunately burdened with the worst voice acting performances. The main <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'I can\'t speak for female Alear since I picked the male version.'">male</text-with-tooltip> character sounds terribly stilted and robotic almost every time he talks, and *many* of the game's supporting characters, such as <span class="spoiler">Baby-talk Veyle (she sounds surprisingly convincing when in her "Evil" form)</span>, Sombron, and mostly all of the Emblems, are equally offensive on the ears.

* Disappointingly, the game's characters are as puddle-deep and one-note as ever (i.e. the "I LOVE EXERCISE" character talks about how much they love exercise in every support convo), which means that most support conversations aren't worth the 3-5 minutes it takes to listen to them. It's also a shame that, unlike past games in the series, units only have supports with select units (i.e. 5-7, rather than the entire cast).

* Support conversations with Emblems (called "Bonds") are even more disposable, literally consisting of 2-4 lines of dialog about trite, meaningless rhetoric (i.e. "When facing adversity, hold strong and believe in your friends to turn the tide of battle", and other such nonsense).

* Map variety is on the thinner side, with about 75% of the missions tasking players to simply defeat all of the opponents units. In addition, <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Moving all of your units in one blob at a time, sticking out a single high-defense unit to lure enemies in.'">"turtling"</text-with-tooltip> is a viable strategy almost every map (unlike *Conquest*, which would heavily punish you for it).

* Aside from resource management (which I think is fun, but I can easily see how some players might find it monotonous), every single activity at <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'The game\s hubworld. Players return to it after every battle.'">the Somniel</text-with-tooltip> is a waste of time. The activities and minigames are unfun, take *far* too long, and the rewards are not worth the time spent. For example, I completely ignored the little cat thing since petting it and feeding it forces players into an unskippable 15-second cutscene *every time*. I also ignored <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'A feature that forces you to watch two characters battle, with the reward being EXP for both units'">the Arena</text-with-tooltip>, <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Mindless and unfun minigames, often requiring you to simply press buttons as fast as you can, that reward players with temporary stat boosts'">the exercise minigames</text-with-tooltip>, cooking, and fishing, and I don't think I regret it.

* As mentioned above, while most of the game's character designs are simply silly (I actually *like* [Timerra's design!](https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/Timerra)), some designs border on ridiculous. Why is [Ivy](https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/Ivy) wearing a *cage* on her face? Was [Celine](https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/C%C3%A9line) modeled after a cupcake? Why does [Panette](https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/Panette) look like [Jack Skellington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Skellington)?

<div class="imageContainer">

  <span class="text--secondary">And for my final question: why are her boobs vacuum-sealed to her dress? Did she use some kind of magic spell? Does double-sided tape exist in the Fire Emblem universe?</span>

## The Ugly Stuff

### Information Management and Discovery
As I said above: the issues above are annoyances, and depending on kind of player you are, some may be more egregious than others.

But one major issue with *Engage* that wasn't really discussed in online discourse is how *poor* the game's information management is. For a game where players need to know as much about the current battle as possible in order to win, I'm honestly shocked how much *Engage* regresses in this area.

For comparison's sake, let's start by taking a look at *Fire Emblem: Awakening*, a game released in 2012 on the 3DS.

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/awakening.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">Despite the low resolution, notice how absolutely jam-packed <i>Awakening's</i> interface is with useful info right at the player's fingertips. <a src="https://discoveringgamedesign.wordpress.com/2015/02/13/closer-look-fire-emblem-awakenings-interface/">Image Credit</a></span>
</div>

[This awesome blog post](https://discoveringgamedesign.wordpress.com/2015/02/13/closer-look-fire-emblem-awakenings-interface/), which deserves its own read, goes into great detail about how *Awakening* made full and excellent use of the 3DS's dual screens. Enemy and player units are clear and distinct, unit stats/weapons/skills are organized and accessible, and with the tap of the screen, the entire map can be displayed on the bottom screen to get a general sense of player/enemy positioning. As an added UX flourish, *anything* can be tapped on to reveal more information. Want to be reminded about what Dexterity does, or the effect of a certain skill? Simply tap on it to reveal a tooltip explaining exactly that. For most humans <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'If you\'re able to remember all 6 modifiable skills for every unit ON TOP OF the skills that Emblems grant, then congrats, you probably smarter than me.'">with average INT stats</text-with-tooltip>, such a feature is invaluable.

Not once while playing *Awakening* did I find it difficult to quickly and efficiently get the information I needed to confidently make decisions.

Now, let's look at *Engage*. Let's say that I want to remind myself what abilities a particular unit has. Here's how I'd do that:

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/scroll.webp'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary"></span>
</div>

To figure out what the right-most ability does, I need to select the unit, press X, and the scroll *all the way* to the right. For those counting at home, that is **14** button presses.

And to view a unit's stats, one has to press the "-" button (which is seldom used in most Switch games), which triggers a 2 second transition to a *different* screen that *replaces* the overhead view. Take a look:

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/stats.jpg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">If you need to be reminded as to what "Luck" does, you'll have to press "Down" about 20 times.</span>
</div>

Great, I can view the unit's stats, but now I can't see the battlefield anymore. What was I doing again? What kinds of enemies is this unit near? Context-switches like these are especially disruptive for a game that is mostly cerebral.

Let's play a different game: in the screenshot below, which unit hasn't yet been moved?

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/feint.jpg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">There is not nearly enough of a distinction between units, which is exacerbated when moved units become gray-tinted.</span>
</div>

After close inspection, the answer is the unit left of the selected unit (Timerra). But how long did it take you to find him? If you're like me, then the answer is "way too long".

This highlights another issue: why do character models (especially when grayed-out) look so *similar* to each other?. By comparison, *Awakening's* 2D sprites are *much* more distinct. 

And to be clear, this is not merely an aesthetic complaint: during my time with *Engage*, I would often misidentify my flying units, thinking I was moving one with high resistance when I was actually a unit with *low* resistance (i.e. Hortensia vs Rosado). This inevitably would lead to cheap, frustrating, and ultimately avoidable deaths.

There are countless other complaints I could levy about this game's interface. For example, the game's minimap display, which used to occupy a bottom screen in previous games, now has three options: hidden, uselessly ant-sized, or gigantically-obtrusive. Couldn't they have picked some middle ground, or allowed players to fiddle with its opacity? And why does it not gray out units that have already moved?

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/stats2.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">Why does Alear have plus 2 strength? It will cost you 8 button presses to figure out that valuable piece of information.</span>
</div>

In case it's not clear, for a game that requires players to have a keen sense on where units are, which abilities and weapons they're equipped with, and what their strengths and weaknesses are, these UI/UX issues are *unacceptable*. For a series that *nailed* this in the past, I'm awestruck as to how unhelpful the game's interface is. Sure, previous games in the series sometimes had two screens, but surely they could have thought of *something* better than what was implemented. 

In summary, for a game on a console with *far* more many pixels than a 3DS, DS, or even a GBA, this game struggles far too much to give players the data that they need, and I sincerely hope that these issues will be addressed in future installments.  

### The Story
My final major gripe with this game is its narrative. Or more specifically, its lack of one.

For those unaware with the *Fire Emblem* series at large, I'd argue that the series has always had a <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'To be fair, I haven\'t played Three Houses, and I hear that its story is actually pretty darn interesting.'">"complicated" relationship</text-with-tooltip> with story-telling. In my opinion, the stories in these games tend to range from "passable" to "disposal", often suffering from overwrought writing, strange narrative choices (i.e. characters dying, but then not?), and lots of pointless meandering (especially in the first half of these games).

I can somewhat sympathize with the jobs of the writers: how does one create a compelling, character-driven narrative in a game where almost *every* recruitable unit can die? And how does one stretch this narrative across 26 chapters and still maintain interest? It sounds like a tough task.

And to be clear, I can confidently state that absolutely nobody plays *Fire Emblem* games for their stories. Indeed, not a single person on this planet has ever uttered the words, "I'm incredibly excited for the next Fire Emblem game's story!" Rather, these games stories are complimentary to what is already deep and addicting experience.

Nevertheless, it would have been nice for *Engage* to have a dramatic story to sink one's teeth into. It would have given the game's strategic decision making some weight, knowing that our choices could dramatically alter the fates of the units that we've grown attached to.

You already know what I'm going to say, but I'm going to say it anyway: *Engage* does not give us that.

Instead, I'd argue that *Engage's* story is one of the most threadbare, uneventful, and uninteresting stories in a game that I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing. Worse than being bad, *Engage's* story is *nothing*.

As soon as I reached the second "country" in this game, I knew *exactly* how the story would play out. And I was right: <span class="spoiler">almost 20 hours of this game is visiting a new country, meeting the royalty there, bad guys invading their country, and then having to team up to take them out. And you do this about 4 times.</span>

It's only until Chapter 21 (<span class="spoiler">out of 27</span>) that anything *really* happens in the game, and by then, it's far too late; players will have likely checked out of the story like I had, skipping cutscenes and clicking through dialog as fast as possible in order to get to parts of the game that are actually fun.

To its credit, *Engage* does hint at a deeper, more complex narrative: <span class="spoiler">What happened during the war 1000 years ago? What series of events concerning the "Foundational Emblem" led to Sombron's campaign of destruction? Why is Zephia so desperate for a family, and what led to the formation of the Four Hounds? In fact, I'd argue that the villains in this game are far more interesting than the main characters.</span>

But unfortunately, none of these questions are ever answered, and we're left with *implications* of a larger, more expansive narrative without it ever being delivered. Instead, *Engage* is content with *telling* us about all these supposedly important events that happened 1000's of years ago, foolishly believing that this is enough to get players invested in it's story. Obviously, it's not.


Over the course of these events, players meet characters that will have minimal to no impact on the story. And yet, players will be forced to endure minutes-long cutscenes with these characters as the blabber on about meaningless nonsense, only to be swiftly forgotten about by the next few chapters.





## Conclusions
