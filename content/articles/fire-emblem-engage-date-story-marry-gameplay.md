## Disclaimers
* This post will avoid all story spoilers, but I'll likely discuss some gameplay mechanics that get introduced as the player progresses.
* I completed the entire game on the "Hard/Classic" difficulty, which took me about 60 hours. I *hate* grinding, so I spent very little time with many of the game's outside-of-battle mechanics.
* I've played about 5 *Fire Emblem* games. I'm no hardcore series veteran, but I know my way around the weapon triangle.

## Context
<info-box :source-name="'Every Game Reviewer in 2023'" :source-link="'https://opencritic.com/game/13896/fire-emblem-engage'">
The story and characters suck, but the gameplay is amazing. Three House's social elements were a waste of time, so less of that is also good. 8/10.

Given that this is, pretty much, the universally-held opinion of everyone online about *Fire Emblem: Engage*, why write a review almost a year after the game's release date? Hasn't everything that one could possible say about this game already been said?

Not quite, in my opinion. Never one for broad-brush generalizations, I think that lots of the discourse surrounding this game leaves out a lot of juicy details that people might (or might not) be interested in. So, in this review, I'll try to focus on aspects of *Engage* that I think weren't talked about enough, but warrant further discussion.

I've been a fan of the series since Awakening (I can hear "LynLover69" physically cringing), but I've played many *Fire Emblem* titles since then. In order of preference, I've also played *Conquest* (3DS), *Echoes: Shadows of Valentia* (3DS, remake of an NES game), and *Sacred Stones* (GBA). I fell in love with the series' unforgiving, calculated gameplay, and *Engage* came out at a time when I wanted more.

In addition, I skipped *Three Houses* (*Engage's* predecessor) due to its reputation for being bloated with silly JRPG social/dating nonsense (I watched in agony as my wife spent countless hours trying maximize social links between party members). *Engage* had been reported by many reviewers to be a much-welcomed course correction from *Three Houses*, so I was eager to give it a go.

So, after managing to bring all of my units safely to the finish line (despite being tempted to offer Bunet as my sacrificial lamb), what did I Think of *Engage*?

## The Good Stuff
### Presentation

  <span class="text--secondary">Say what you want about the character designs, but there's no denying that <i>Engage's</i> art style can be striking at times. <a src="https://serenesforest.net/2022/11/29/fire-emblem-engage-emblem-celica-analysis/">Image Credit</a></span>

Listen: I hate silly anime designs as much as the next guy. When screenshots of this game first came out, fans of the series starting referring to the main character as "[Toothpaste-chan](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/alear-toothpaste-chan)", and I can't say that I disagree.

But despite this, I'll admit that I *really* like *Engage's* art style. It brings a brightness and energy that helps keeps things visually appealing, which is important since some players (like myself) may find themselves starting at the screen for minutes at a time, pondering their next move.

I'd argue that Engage doesn't use bright colors randomly; for as chaotic as *Engage* can be, there is a consistency to its design and color use. It's use of neon blue blends contrasts excellently with the various pinks, greens, and yellows (and of course, matches the [hair color](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KqF9G_DQls) of almost every character in the game), and despite being few in number, its pre-rendered cutscenes can be a joy to look at.

And, as expected from any mainline Nintendo game, *Engage's* music is simply phenomenal (exlcuding its <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Attention anime/videogame composers: instrumental melodies are NOT interchangable with lyrical melodies! A melody that sounds great when played on a guitar will NOT NECESSARILY sound great when sung!'">terrible opening theme</text-with-tooltip>). Again, this serves not only an aesthetic purpose, but a functional one: I couldn't help but move and groove during my calculations on the battlefield, which helps alleviate the occasional tedium while waiting for enemies to move, or battle animations to finish.

### Gameplay
Yes, I said that I was going to touch on aspects that *weren't* talked about to death, but it bears repeating that the moment-to-moment gameplay during battles is peak *Fire Emblem*. For those that aren't familiar with *Fire Emblem*, the gameplay premise is pretty simple: players must use their "chess pieces", each with their own abilities, strengths, and weaknesses, to defeat opponents on a grid-like board.

In my opinion, *Fire Emblem* is at its best when it feels like you're playing *chess*, rather than a typical strategy RPG. Sure, stats, XP, and character progression can be compelling features that encourage player freedom and choice, but they can also disrupt the balance of strategy RPGs. Being overleveled (either on purpose or by accident) tends to trivialize the strategy experience, while being *under*leveled tends to force players to waste time by grinding and/or engaging in silly minigames solely to boost stats. I'd rather win a tough battle of *wits*, rather than a battle of *patience and time*.

In this sense, I'm happy to report that *Engage* gave me what I was looking for: despite playing on Hard mode, I was able to complete the game without any grinding or abuse of its systems whatsoever, with it still providing a decent challenge. Sure, the options to overlevel one's units are there for players that are looking for an easier or simpler experience, but if one is paying attention, *Engage* gives players everything they need to exceed *without* demanding that they waste time grinding.

I think Engage's strategic gameplay excels partly because of the re-introduction (with a subtle twist) of the series' classic <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Swords beat Axes, Axes beat Lances, and Lances Beat Swords'">"weapon triangle"</text-with-tooltip>. As opposed to *Three Houses*, which
