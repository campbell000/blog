## Disclaimers
* This post will avoid all story spoilers, but I'll likely discuss some gameplay mechanics that get introduced as the player progresses.
* I completed the entire game on the "Hard/Classic" difficulty, which took me about 60 hours. I *hate* grinding, so I spent very little time with many of the game's outside-of-battle mechanics.
* I've played about 5 *Fire Emblem* games. I'm no hardcore series veteran, but I know my way around the weapon triangle.

## Context
<info-box :source-name="'Every Game Reviewer in 2023'" :source-link="'https://opencritic.com/game/13896/fire-emblem-engage'">
The story and characters suck, but the gameplay is amazing. Three House's social elements were a waste of time, so less of that is also good. 8/10.
</info-box>

Given that this is, pretty much, the universally-held opinion of everyone online about *Fire Emblem: Engage*, why write a review almost a year after the game's release date? Hasn't everything that one could possible say about this game already been said?

Not quite, in my opinion. Never one for broad-brush generalizations, I think that lots of the discourse surrounding this game leaves out a lot of juicy details that people might otherwise be interested in. So, in this review, I'll try to focus on aspects of *Engage* that I think weren't talked about enough, but warrant further discussion.

I've been a fan of the series since Awakening (I can hear "LynLover69" physically cringing), but I've played many *Fire Emblem* titles since then. In order of preference, I've also played *Conquest* and its DLC campaign (3DS), *Echoes: Shadows of Valentia* (3DS, remake of an NES game), and *Sacred Stones* (GBA). I fell in love with the series' unforgiving, calculated gameplay, and *Engage* came out at a time when I wanted more.

I actually skipped *Three Houses* (*Engage's* predecessor) due to its reputation for being bloated with silly JRPG social/dating nonsense (I watched in agony as my wife spent countless hours trying maximize social links between party members). *Engage* had been reported by many reviewers to be a much-welcomed course correction from *Three Houses*, so I was eager to give it a go.

So, after managing to bring all of my units safely to the finish line (despite being tempted to offer Bunet as my sacrificial lamb), what did I Think of *Engage*?

## The Good Stuff
### Presentation
<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/fecolor.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">Say what you want about the character designs, but there's no denying that <i>Engage's</i> art style can be striking at times. <a src="https://serenesforest.net/2022/11/29/fire-emblem-engage-emblem-celica-analysis/">Image Credit: Serenes Forest</a></span>
</div>

Listen: I hate silly anime designs as much as the next guy. When screenshots of this game first came out, fans of the series starting disaffectionately referring to the main character as "[Toothpaste-chan](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/alear-toothpaste-chan)", and I can't say that I disagree; his/her design *is* ridiculous (and the female version's tie-between-the-boobs look is just...so...stupid).

But despite this, I'll admit that I *really* like *Engage's* art style. It brings a brightness and energy that helps keeps things visually appealing, which is important since some players (like myself) may find themselves starting at the screen for minutes at a time, pondering their next move.

I'd argue that Engage doesn't use bright colors randomly; for as chaotic as *Engage* can be, there is a consistency to its design and color use. It's use of neon blue blends contrasts excellently with the various pinks, greens, and yellows (and of course, matches the [hair color](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KqF9G_DQls) of almost every character in the game), and despite being few in number, its pre-rendered cutscenes can be a joy to look at.

And, as expected from any mainline Nintendo game, *Engage's* music is simply phenomenal (excluding its <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Attention anime/videogame composers: instrumental melodies are NOT interchangeable with lyrical melodies! A melody that sounds great when played on a guitar will NOT NECESSARILY sound great when sung!'">terrible opening theme</text-with-tooltip>). Again, this serves not only an aesthetic purpose, but a functional one: I couldn't help but move and groove during my calculations on the battlefield, which helps alleviate the occasional tedium while waiting for enemies to move, or battle animations to finish.

<youtube-link :src-link="'https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j3UmYT3fSic?si=nlIE8Kv2wvKbqcLs'">This song's use of <i>Fire Emblem's</i> main theme is simply to <i>die</i> for. And that theremin! Such an odd, yet unique, choice.</youtube-link>

I also have to mention that (again, aside from a few stinkers like the main male protagonist) there are some *steller* voice acting performances in this game. Goldmary, Ivy, and Yunaka stand out as a joy to listen to.

Put simply, this is *by far* the best looking and best sounding *Fire Emblem* game to date. 

### Gameplay
Yes, I said that I was going to touch on aspects that *weren't* talked about to death, but it bears repeating that the moment-to-moment gameplay during battles is peak *Fire Emblem*. For those that aren't familiar with *Fire Emblem*, the gameplay premise is pretty simple: players must use their "chess pieces", each with their own abilities, strengths, and weaknesses, to defeat opponents on a grid-like board. 

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/fegameplay.jpg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">Thinking several moves ahead (again, like Chess) will prove vital in ensuring that all of a player's units survive. <a src="https://www.eurogamer.net/fire-emblem-engage-is-a-proud-celebration-of-all-that-came-before-it">Image Credit: Eurogamer</a></span>
</div>

In my opinion, *Fire Emblem* is at its best when it feels like you're playing *chess*, rather than a typical RPG. Sure, stats, EXP, and character progression can be compelling features that encourage player freedom and choice, but they can also disrupt a game's balance. Being overleveled (either on purpose or by accident) tends to trivialize the strategy experience, while being *under*leveled tends to force players to waste time by grinding and/or engaging in silly minigames solely to boost stats. 

Put another way, I'd rather win a battle of *wits*, rather than a battle of *patience and time*.

In this sense, I'm happy to report that *Engage* gives me what I was looking for: despite playing on Hard mode, I was able to complete the game without any grinding or abuse of its systems whatsoever, with it still providing a decent challenge. Sure, the options to overlevel one's units are there for players that are looking for an easier or simpler experience, but if one is paying attention, *Engage* gives players everything they need to exceed *without* demanding that they waste their precious time <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Some people online have complained that Engage doesn\'t give you enough crafting materials or gold, but I think they\'re missing the point: the game is fun precisely BECAUSE you have to make hard decisions about resource allocation.'">grinding for experience or items</text-with-tooltip>.

I think *Engage's* strategic gameplay excels partly because of the re-introduction (with a subtle twist) of the series' classic <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Swords beat axes, axes beat lances, and lances Beat swords. Oh, and mages\' weakness is PUNCHING.'">"weapon triangle"</text-with-tooltip>. Sorely missing from *Three Houses*, the weapon triangle gives each unit a clear role to nestle into: archers are great for keeping flying enemies at bay, mages obliterate otherwise-formidable armored units, and good ole' fists can be used to punch mages in their stupid, conceited faces. Rather than simply picking one's highest-level units, the weapon triangle forces players to survey the battlefield before deploying to determine which units might work best for the situation at hand.

This ties into other reason that *Engage's* gameplay excels: there are *so many* tools at the player's disposal that they can leverage, and this is, in part, thanks to the game's ingenious <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'When paired with Fire Emblem characters from past games, represented as rings, your units can temporarily boost their stats and abilities, which can be enough to bring back a battle from the brink of defeat.'">"Emblem system"</text-with-tooltip>. There are many, many ways in which players can distribute their emblem rings, with each ring having class-dependent effects on its recipient.

Want to temporarily give your healing mage +5 range? Want to spawn giant ice pillar blockades to give your units time to heal? What about an ability that draws enemies in for one turn, culminating in a huge multi-space explosion on the next turn? The Emblem system makes this, and more, possible.

While initially overwhelming, this system smartly encourages player experimentation and creativity, leading to endless strategic possibilities. For example, one of my favorite moments with *Engage* was when I concocted a hare-brained strategy that hinged upon using <span class="spoiler">Veyle</span> and Micaiah to launch Timerra and Ike half-way across the map, and the payoff when it actually *worked* was incredible. 

Even *more* interesting is that enemies can use these emblems and their abilities, too. I'll admit that the Emblems seemed a little *too* overpowered in *Engage's* first half, but proved to be absolutely essential in the second half in order to contend with enemies using these same tools against you.

One final note on the game's <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'For each battle, the game gives you 10 opportunities to revert the game\'s state back to an earlier point in time.'">"rewind system"</text-with-tooltip>: some people online seem to absolutely *detest* its inclusion in modern *Fire Emblem* games, but I think most of their arguments boil down to "you're not a real gamer". Fortunately for me, I value my time far greater than what people on the internet that I've never met think of me, and I'd imagine that most well-adjusted players will feel the same. I *suppose* you could make an argument that the absence of a safety net makes battles more tense and dramatic, but no one is forcing a gun to anyone's head to use the feature. Overall, I welcomed the feature.

In summary: *Engage* is a strategy game, first and foremost. Past the anime cringe, threadbare story, and sleep-inducing downtime between battles (all of which I'll get to below), the game is a masterclass in addictive, thoughtful, and flexible strategy game design. For that reason alone, I'd recommend it both to newcomers to the genre *and* fans of the series.

## The Bad Stuff
Unfortunately, despite my praise, there are a number of issues with this game that keep it from being truly sublime. I'd wager that most of them won't be deal beakers for most people, so instead of spending paragraphs on each one, I'll briefly touch on each point:

* The characters with the most lines of dialog in this game are unfortunately coupled with the worst voice acting performances. This includes </span><text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'I can\'t speak for female Alear since I picked the male version.'">male</text-with-tooltip> Alear, Sombron, all of the Emblems, and <span class="spoiler">Baby-talk Veyle (though she sounds surprisingly competent when in her "Evil" form)</span>. I cannot overstate how robotic and stilted male Alear sounds in almost every cutscene.


* Support conversations with Emblems (called "Bonds") are literally consist of 2-4 lines of dialog about trite, meaningless rhetoric (i.e. "When facing adversity, hold strong and believe in your friends to turn the tide of battle"). It would have been nice to actually form connections with characters from past *Fire Emblem* games.

* Map variety is on the thinner side, with about 75% of the missions tasking players to simply defeat all of the opponents units. <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Moving all of your units in one blob at a time, sticking out a single high-defense unit to lure enemies in.'">"Turtling"</text-with-tooltip> is a viable strategy for almost every map (unlike *Conquest*, which would heavily punish you for it), which makes things a little stale.

* Aside from resource management (which I think is fun, but I can easily see how some players might find it monotonous), every single activity at <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'The game\s hubworld. Players return to it after every battle.'">the Somniel</text-with-tooltip> is a waste of time. The activities and minigames are unfun, take *far* too long, and the rewards are not worth the time spent. For example, I completely ignored the little cat thing since petting it and feeding it forces players into an mandatory 15-second cutscene *every time*. *WHY are they not skippable???*

* As mentioned above, while most of the game's character designs are simply silly (I actually *like* [Timerra's design!](https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/Timerra)), some designs border on ridiculous. Why is [Ivy](https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/Ivy) wearing a *cage* on her face? Was [Celine](https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/C%C3%A9line) modeled after a cupcake? Why does [Panette](https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/Panette) look like [Jack Skellington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Skellington)?

<div class="imageContainer">

  <span class="text--secondary">And for my final question: why are her boobs vacuum-sealed to her dress? Does double-sided sticky tape exist in the Fire Emblem universe?</span>

## The Ugly Stuff

### Information Management and Discovery
As I said above: the issues above are annoyances, and depending on kind of player you are, some may be more egregious than others.

But one major issue with *Engage* that doesn't seem to be present in online discourse is how *poor* the game's information management is. For a game where players need to know as much about the current battle as possible in order to win, I'm honestly shocked how much *Engage* regresses in this area.

For comparison's sake, let's start by taking a look at *Fire Emblem: Awakening*, a game released in 2012 on the 3DS.

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/awakening.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">Despite the low resolution, notice how absolutely jam-packed <i>Awakening's</i> interface is with useful info right at the player's fingertips. <a src="https://discoveringgamedesign.wordpress.com/2015/02/13/closer-look-fire-emblem-awakenings-interface/">Image Credit: Discovering Game Design</a></span>
</div>

[This awesome blog post](https://discoveringgamedesign.wordpress.com/2015/02/13/closer-look-fire-emblem-awakenings-interface/), which deserves its own read, goes into great detail about how *Awakening* made full and excellent use of the 3DS's dual screens. Enemy and player units are clear and distinct, unit stats/weapons/skills are organized and accessible, and with the tap of the screen, the entire map can be displayed on the bottom screen to get a general sense of player/enemy positioning. As an added UX flourish, *anything* can be tapped on to reveal more information. Want to be reminded about what Dexterity does, or the effect of a certain skill? Simply tap on it to reveal a tooltip explaining exactly that. For most humans <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'If you\'re able to remember all 6 modifiable skills for every unit ON TOP OF the skills that Emblems grant, then congrats, you\'re smarter than me.'">with average INT stats</text-with-tooltip>, such a feature is invaluable.

Not once while playing *Awakening* did I find it difficult to quickly and efficiently get the information I needed to confidently make decisions.

Now, let's look at *Engage*. Let's say that I want to remind myself what abilities a particular unit has. Here's how I'd do that:

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/scroll.webp'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary"></span>
</div>

To figure out what the right-most ability does, I need to select the unit, press X, and the scroll *all the way* to the right. For those counting at home, that is **14** button presses. 

To answer clever readers that might be thinking, "well, obviously you're playing in *Docked* mode! Surely you can tap on the interface while undocked!", then I'd agree with you: that would be an *perfectly sufficient* compromise. But no, *Fire Emblem: Engage* for the Nintendo Switch, featuring an OLED 6-inch touchscreen, does *not* utilize the touch screen.

Confusingly, the interface also omits certain stats, such as Dexterity, Dodge, and Luck, the first two being *really* important in the latter half of the game. To view these stats, one has to press the "-" button (which is seldom used in most Switch games), which triggers a 2 second transition to a *different* screen that *replaces* the overhead view. Take a look:

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/stats.jpg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">If you need to be reminded as to what "Luck" does, you'll have to press "Down" about 20 times.</span>
</div>

Great, I can view the unit's stats, but now I can't see the battlefield anymore. What was I doing again? What kinds of enemies is this unit near? Context-switches like these are especially disruptive for a game that is mostly cerebral.

Let's play a different game: in the screenshot below, which unit hasn't yet been moved?

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/feint.jpg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">There is not nearly enough of a distinction between units, which is exacerbated when moved units become gray-tinted.</span>
</div>

The answer is: the unit left of the selected unit (Timerra). But how long did it take you to find him? If you're like me, then the answer is "way too long".

This highlights another issue: why do character models (especially when grayed-out) look so *similar* to each other?. By comparison, *Awakening's* 2D sprites are *much* more distinct. 

And to be clear, this is not merely an aesthetic complaint: during my time with *Engage*, I would often misidentify my flying units, thinking I was moving one with high resistance when I was actually a unit with *low* resistance (i.e. Hortensia vs Rosado). This inevitably would lead to cheap, frustrating, and ultimately avoidable deaths.

There are countless other complaints I could levy about this game's interface. For example, the game's minimap display, which used to occupy a bottom screen in previous games, now has three options: hidden, uselessly ant-sized, or gigantically-obtrusive. Couldn't they have picked some middle ground, or allowed players to fiddle with its opacity? And why does it not gray out units that have already moved? Coupled with a camera that is also either way too zoomed in or way too zoomed out, the uselessness of *Engage's* minimap makes it far too difficult to get a sense of overall unit positioning.

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/stats2.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">Why does Alear have a +2 speed modifier? It will cost you 11 button presses to figure out that valuable piece of information.</span>
</div>

In case it's not clear, for a game that requires players to have a keen sense on where units are, which abilities and weapons they're equipped with, and what their strengths and weaknesses are, these UI/UX issues are *unacceptable*. For a series that has traditionally *nailed* this, I'm awestruck as to how unhelpful the game's interface is. Sure, previous games in the series sometimes had two screens to work with, but surely they could have thought of *something* better than what was implemented. 

In summary, for a game on a console with *far* more many pixels than a 3DS, DS, or even a GBA, this game struggles far too much to give players the data that they need, and I sincerely hope that these issues will be addressed in future installments.  

### The Story
My final major gripe with this game is its narrative. Or more specifically, its lack of one.

Let me start with an example. Very minor spoilers below:

Picture all of your units, along with their Emblems, <span class="spoiler">pledging to you their lives to fight one final battle. Some have been undyingly loyal from day one, while others have acquiesced to fate, recognizing that differences must be set aside in order to save the world. Even if we win, things won't go back to how they once were. We'll have to rebuild, compromise, and persevere, and not all of us will make it to the other side.</span>

<span class="spoiler">Cringe-inducing anime rhetoric aside, it really *does* feel like the world hinges on this final battle. The music swells in intensity while the main villain snarls one final vicious, yet despondent, insult, as if your very existence is nothing but a hinderance.</span>

Finally, as the battle starts, the music below cuts through the melodrama to kick the action into high-gear, giving your pondering and strategizing a sense of urgency, but also purpose and meaning.

<youtube-link :src-link="'https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MNJqgyNgCYA?si=k9Rnx5R07acBrGW0&amp;start=59'">Without lyrics, the game's main theme is actually really cool.</youtube-link>

This was such a cool moment for me; it actually gave weight to the decisions that I had made up to that point and beyond, and is what most strategy games should aspire to achieve.

So, how does this square with my complaint about *Engage's* narrative? Well, it's because the moment that I described above happens at the *very last battle of the entire game*, and it's the one and only time that *Engage* had elicited those feelings from me.

In other words, it takes roughly 40-60 hours for *Engage* to give the player any sense of purpose. And by that point, most players will have already completely checked out. I, myself, had started to skip cutscenes and support conversations by that point.

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/cutscene.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">The pre-rendered cutscenes are nice, but are very few and far between. <a src="https://www.thumbculture.co.uk/fire-emblem-engage-switch-review">Image Credit: Thumb Culture</a></span>
</div>

This is because the majority of the game's narrative follows a dreadfully-predictable formula based on recruitment: players are linearly shuffled around to the world's various countries in order to recruit units. At each country, the local royal figures are threatened somehow by evil, and it's up to the player to stop them, culminating in some of them joining our cause.

I hate it when <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Both Zelda games on the Switch are prime examples of this: nothing of interest happens in either game until all four guardians are recruited.'">games</text-with-tooltip> telegraph this "recruitment" based narrative structure because it makes it *very* clear to the player that absolutely nothing of significance will happen until all X characters/crystals/whatever are collected. And sure enough, as soon as I landed in Firene and saw that there were 3 more countries on the map, I knew exactly how things were going to go.

Some games, however, manage to get away with these recruitment-based stories without feeling formulaic. Recruitment stories don't *have* to be bland and predictable if each character's smaller, more-personal conflicts are engaging. Mass effect, for example, handles this by dedicating a *lot* of time to these new characters' localized conflicts, which often have knock-on effects on the main story in interesting and unexpected ways (i.e. the Wrex and the "Genophage").

Unfortunately, *Engage* spectacularly fails at generating any interest at all in these new recruits. As units join the player's army, they're given about 5 minutes of screen time until they're whisked away to permanently live in the game's menus, never to be heard from again aside from the occasional anime chirp (i.e. "Divine Dragon, please believe in yourself!"). Sure, they're happy to chatter away during support conversations, but aside from a <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'For some reason, the game reserves intrigue and nuance exclusively for it villain characters, such as Zephia, Ivy, and Hortensia. They are far more complex and interesting than anyone else, including the main character. Yuanaka is also endearingly oddball-ish'">few exceptions</text-with-tooltip>, these optional cutscenes do little more than establishing that "this one likes to exercise", or "this one wants to be cute".

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/supports.webp'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">I wonder what the chef-looking character that loves to cook will talk to me about?</span>
</div>

I can somewhat sympathize with *Engage's* writers: how do you weave characters into a game's plot when almost each and every one of them <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'The Fire Emblem series is somewhat famous for its "perma-death" design: when characters are defeated on the battlefield, they\'re typically gone for good.'">can be killed</text-with-tooltip>? How do you lend depth to a character that never really faces any struggles or challenges since the game's design prevents them from being involved?

If the series wants to cling to its perma-death design, then I don't think that this is a problem that can be solved. The only thing that I can think of is to potentially decrease the number of recruitable units so that the game can spend more time with the ones that already exist. 

But regardless of why, the end result is that *Engage's* narrative loses steam *very* quickly because its characters fail to generate any sort of interest or intrigue. And I've said this before: without compelling characters, there is no *story*. There's just things that happen.

To its credit, *Engage* does hint at something deeper with its characters: <span class="spoiler">What exactly happened during the war 1000 years ago? What series of events concerning the "Foundational Emblem" led to Sombron's campaign of destruction? Why is Zephia so desperate for a family, and what led to the formation of the Four Hounds?</span>.

But unfortunately, none of these questions are <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'It\'s possible that the DLC delves into this, but that is not even remotely good enough of an justification for leaving these points out of the main game. A $60 game shouldn\'t require additional purchases in order to make a narrative whole.'">ever answered</text-with-tooltip>, and we're left with *implications* of a larger, more expansive narrative without it ever being delivered. Instead, *Engage* is content with *telling* us about all these supposedly important events that happened 1000's of years ago, foolishly believing that this is enough to get players invested in it's story. Obviously, it's not.

Nevertheless, this is precisely *why* I wanted to begin this section with that single example of a time where *Engage's* narrative was thrilling and tense; it suggests that it's possible for a *Fire Emblem* game to be both mechanically *and* narratively complex.

But unfortunately, that lone example highlights instead serves to emphasize how disappointing the rest of the game is. *Engage's* narrative could have been great, but it's perhaps one of the blandest, uninteresting stories in the entire series (and I've played *Fates*, which is routinely mocked for its terrible story).

## Conclusion

</div>
With all of that said (goddamnit, why am I so bad at keeping these reviews succinct?), I can confidently state that absolutely nobody plays *Fire Emblem* games for their stories. Indeed, not a single person on this planet has ever uttered the words, "I'm incredibly excited for the next Fire Emblem game's story!" Rather, these games stories are complimentary to what is almost always a deep and addicting experience.

Nevertheless, it would have been nice for *Engage* to have a dramatic story to sink one's teeth into. Maybe I *do* need to play *Three Houses*...

In conclusion, I suppose this review *can* be summed up as:

<info-box :source-name="'Nevermeant.dev'" :source-link="'https://opencritic.com/game/13896/fire-emblem-engage'">
The story and characters suck, but the gameplay is amazing. Three House's social elements were a waste of time, so less of that is also good. 8/10.
</info-box>

In all seriousness, I hope this review has either nudged prospective players of *Engage* closer to a decision, or provided some interesting points to consider for those that have already played this game.

(One final note: not a single *Engage* pun can be found in this review. I'm incredibly proud of myself for that.)

**Verdict: 4 Critical Hits out of 5**
