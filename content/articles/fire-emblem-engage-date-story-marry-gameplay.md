## Disclaimers
* This post will avoid all story spoilers, but I'll likely discuss some gameplay mechanics that get introduced as the player progresses.
* I completed the entire game on the "Hard/Classic" difficulty, which took me about 60 hours. I *hate* grinding, so I spent very little time with many of the game's outside-of-battle mechanics (but completed many of the Paralogues)
* I've played about 5 *Fire Emblem* games. I'm no hardcore series veteran, but I know my way around the weapon triangle.
* I've never played *Three Houses*, but I watched my wife play through it.

## Context
<info-box :source-name="'Every Game Reviewer in 2023'" :source-link="'https://opencritic.com/game/13896/fire-emblem-engage'">
The story and characters suck, but the gameplay is amazing. Three House's social elements were a waste of time, so less of that is also good. 8/10.
</info-box>

Given that this is, pretty much, the universally-held opinion of *Fire Emblem: Engage*, why write a review almost a year after the game's release date? Hasn't everything that one could possible say about this game already been said?

While not necessarily inaccurate (I'll get to that in a bit), I don't think that this opinion does *Engage* favors. I can say for myself that this sentiment was not very helpful, since I've never played *Three Houses*, nor do I plan to. I also don't think *Engage* is merely "good enough" for a *Fire Emblem* game. Instead, I think it does a *lot* of things right (as well as a lot of things wrong) that warrant further discussion.

I've been a fan of the series since *Fire Emblem: Awakening* (I can hear "LynLover86" physically cringing), but I've played many *Fire Emblem* titles since then. In order of preference, I've also played *Conquest* and its DLC campaign (3DS), *Echoes: Shadows of Valentia* (3DS, remake of an NES game), and *Sacred Stones* (GBA). But starting with *Awakening*, I immediately fell in love with the series' unforgiving, calculated gameplay. There's nothing else quite like it.

I passed on *Three Houses* (*Engage's* predecessor) due to how heavily it appeared to lean on its <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Seeing my wife spend her precious time organizing tea parties with the game\'s NPCs didn\'t exactly pique my interest...'">social sim elements</text-with-tooltip>, and since *Engage's* reviews seemed to imply that these elements had been significantly pared back, I figured that *Engage* would be a great time for me to jump back into the series.

</div>

So, after managing to bring all of my units safely to the finish line (despite being tempted to offer Bunet as my sacrificial <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Get it? He\'s the character that likes to cook! Funny, right?'">lambchop</text-with-tooltip>), what did I think of *Engage*?

## The Good Stuff
### Presentation
Listen: I hate silly anime designs as much as the next guy. When screenshots of this game first came out, fans of the series starting disaffectionately referring to the main character as "[Toothpaste-chan](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/alear-toothpaste-chan)", and I can't say that I disagree; his/her design *is* ridiculous (doubly so for the female version's accentuating-tie-between-the-boobs look).

But despite this, I'll admit that I *really* like *Engage's* vibrant art style. It lends a brightness and energy to the experience that (in my opinion) gives the game a more modern-looking feel.

This carries over to the game's character design; yes, the game still borrows heavily from the high-fantasy genre, showcasing lances, capes, cloaks, and lace. But when paired with Emblems, units inherit their neon glows, augmenting their appearances in interesting ways. Some characters sprout futuristic wings, while others are adorned with <a target="_blank" href="/future.jpeg">spinning propulsion systems</a>. As to *how* these cyberpunk influences make sense in the *Fire Emblem* universe, I'm not sure. But if I'm being honest, I'd call it a welcome change-up from a style that the series has gotten, perhaps, too comfortable with.

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/fecolor.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">Say what you want about the character designs, but there's no denying that <i>Engage's</i> art style can be striking at times. <a src="https://serenesforest.net/2022/11/29/fire-emblem-engage-emblem-celica-analysis/">Image Credit: Serenes Forest</a></span>
</div>

This also serves a functional purpose: compared to <a target="_blank" href="/3houses.jpeg">its predecessor</a>, which often looked no better than an early PS3-era mess of grays and brown, *Engage's* vibrancy makes units "pop" against the background. This makes it *much* easier for players to answer critical questions like, "where are my positional weak points?", or "where should I begin my assault?", or "who is going to die next turn unless I intervene?". The strategy game experience hinges upon how easy or difficult it is to get this kind of info, and while not perfect (I'll get to that below), *Engage* is a definite step in the right direction in this regard.

And, as expected from any mainline Nintendo game, *Engage's* music is simply phenomenal (excluding its <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Attention anime/videogame composers: instrumental melodies are NOT interchangeable with lyrical melodies! A melody that sounds great when played on a guitar will NOT NECESSARILY sound great when sung!'">terrible opening theme</text-with-tooltip>). The game has an excellent sense of audio awareness: it knows when to deploy something soft and sweet (i.e. the link below), it knows when to ramp up the tempo to get players pumped for the upcoming siege.

Most importantly (and I can't stress this enough), it knows when to get out of the way; most of *Engage's* mid-battle music is catchy, but not obtrusive or attention-grabbing, giving players plenty of mental space to think. Far too often do games (anime games in particular) get carried away with complicated melodies during moments that deserve attention elsewhere, and *Engage* is deeply respectful of that.

<youtube-link :src-link="'https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j3UmYT3fSic?si=nlIE8Kv2wvKbqcLs'">This song's use of <i>Fire Emblem's</i> main theme is simply to <i>die</i> for. And that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin">theremin!</a> Such an unexpected, yet interesting, choice of instrumentation.</youtube-link>

Speaking of audio, I also have to mention that (aside from a few stinkers like the main male protagonist) there are some *steller* voice acting performances in this game. [Censorship controversy aside](https://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/10ejmqf/fe_engage_censorship_discusiion/), characters like Goldmary, Ivy, and Yunaka give standout performances.

Put simply, this is *by far* the best looking and best sounding *Fire Emblem* game to date. 

### Gameplay
Yes, I said that I was going to touch on aspects that *weren't* talked about to death, but it bears repeating that the moment-to-moment gameplay during battles is peak *Fire Emblem*. I'm going to avoid explaining the ins-and-outs of the mechanics (you can find that [here](https://www.ign.com/wikis/fire-emblem-engage/Beginner's_Guide)) so that I can focus on commentary, rather than explanations. But if you decide to stop reading here, let me reiterate: if you like *Fire Emblem* games, then *Engage* is a must-play.

For those still with me, let me expand on that: in my opinion, *Fire Emblem* is at its best when it feels like you're playing *chess*, rather than a typical RPG. Sure, stats, EXP, and character progression can be compelling features that encourage player freedom and choice, but they can also disrupt a game's balance. Being overleveled tends to trivialize the strategy experience, while being *under*leveled tends to force players to waste time grinding or playing silly minigames.

Put another way, I'd rather win a battle of *wits*, rather than a battle of *patience*.

In this sense, I'm happy to report that, despite it containing a plethora of ways to waste players' time, *Engage* is still more than willing to get out of its own way. None of the game's silly systems (tea parties, ring polishing, "Take care of a virtual cat-looking thing", etc) are required to succeed in *Engage*.

Want proof? Despite me being of average intelligence and having less-than-average patience, I was able to complete the game on Hard/<text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'In \'Classic\' mode, when units die, they are dead for good. This USED to be the norm for Fire Emblem games, but recent installments have made this feature opt-in.'">Classic</text-with-tooltip> mode without interacting with *any* of these features. Instead, *Engage* helpfully gives players everything they need to succeed as long as they pay careful attention to the way they <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Some people online have complained that Engage doesn\'t give you enough crafting materials or gold, but I think they\'re missing the point: the game is fun precisely BECAUSE you have to make hard decisions about where to spend your resources.'">allocate resources</text-with-tooltip>.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/fegameplay.jpg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">Thinking several moves ahead (again, like Chess) will prove vital in ensuring that all of a player's units survive. <a src="https://www.eurogamer.net/fire-emblem-engage-is-a-proud-celebration-of-all-that-came-before-it">Image Credit: Eurogamer</a></span>
</div>

I think *Engage's* strategic gameplay excels partly because of the re-introduction (with a subtle twist) of the series' classic <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Swords beat axes, axes beat lances, and lances Beat swords. Oh, and mages\' weakness is PUNCHING.'">"weapon triangle"</text-with-tooltip>, which gives each unit a clear role to nestle into. Archers are great for keeping flying enemies at bay, mages obliterate otherwise-formidable armored units, and good ole' fists can be used to punch mages in their stupid, conceited faces. 

Rather than simply picking one's highest-level units, the weapon triangle forces players to survey the battlefield before deploying to determine which units might work best for the situation at hand. This has the effect of making battles less about resources and EXP, and more about knowing what tools to use at the right times and in the right positions.

This ties into other reason that *Engage's* gameplay excels: there are *so many* tools at the player's disposal that they can leverage, and this is, in part, thanks to the game's ingenious <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'When paired with Fire Emblem characters from past games, represented as rings, your units can temporarily boost their stats and abilities, which can be enough to bring back a battle from the brink of defeat.'">"Emblem system"</text-with-tooltip>. There are many, many ways in which players can distribute their emblem rings, with each ring having class-dependent effects on its recipient.

Want to temporarily give your healing mage +5 range? Want to spawn giant ice pillar blockades to give your units time to heal? What about an ability that draws enemies in for one turn, culminating in a huge multi-space explosion on the next turn? The Emblem system makes this, and more, possible since *any* unit can be paired with *any* Emblem.

While initially overwhelming, this system smartly encourages player experimentation and creativity, leading to endless strategic possibilities. For example, one of my favorite moments with *Engage* was when I concocted a hare-brained strategy that hinged upon using <span class="spoiler">Veyle</span> and Micaiah to launch Timerra and Ike half-way across the map, and the payoff when it actually *worked* was incredible. 

Even *more* interesting is that enemies can use these emblems and their abilities, too. I'll admit that the Emblems seemed a little *too* overpowered in *Engage's* first half, but proved to be absolutely essential in the second half in order to contend with enemies using these same tools against you.

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/evilmarth.webp'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">Enemies can use Emblems, too. For example, Lyn's "Astra Storm", which fires a barrage of arrows from a million miles away, can be particularly disruptive to an otherwise ironclad strategy. <a src="https://serenesforest.net/2022/11/29/fire-emblem-engage-emblem-celica-analysis/">Image Credit: Tech Raptor</a></span>
</div>

And if the complexity of this sounds scary to you, then fear not: *Engage* throws a bone to those that are put off by too much tinkering by suggesting default pairings of units to Emblems. For example, Marth is naturally paired with Alear, Timmera is naturally paired with Ike, etc. So, if you'd rather have this process streamlined, *Engage* is willing to help.


I also want to briefly discuss the game's <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'For each battle, the game gives you 10 opportunities to revert the game\'s state back to an earlier point in time.'">"rewind system"</text-with-tooltip>: some people online seem to absolutely *detest* its inclusion in modern *Fire Emblem* games, but I think most of their arguments boil down to "you're not a real gamer". Fortunately for me, my time is far more valuable than the opinions of people on the internet that I've never met, and I'd imagine that most well-adjusted players will feel the same. I *suppose* you could make an argument that the absence of a safety net could make battles more tense, but no one is forcing a gun to anyone's head to use it. Overall, I welcomed the feature.

In summary:  above all else, *Engage* is a strategy game. Past the anime cringe, threadbare story, and sleep-inducing downtime between battles (all of which I'll get to below), the game is a masterclass in addictive, thoughtful, and flexible strategy game design. For that reason alone, I'd recommend it both to newcomers to the genre *and* fans of the series.

## The Bad Stuff
Unfortunately, despite my praise, there are a number of issues with this game that keep it from being truly sublime. I'd wager that most of them won't be deal beakers for most people, so instead of spending paragraphs on each one, I'll briefly touch on each point:

* I cannot overstate how robotic and stilted the main (male) character's performance is, which is unfortunate because he has, by far, the most lines in the game. His performance is severely over-enunciated, which elicited only a single thought in my head: "human beings don't speak like that". The voice actors that were willing to be looser with their enunciation and breathing (again, like Yunaka and Ivy) sound *far* more natural.

* Support conversations with Emblems (called "Bonds") consist of two characters spouting meaningless rhetoric at each other (i.e. "When facing adversity, hold strong and believe in your friends to turn the tide of battle"). It would have been nice to actually converse with past *Fire Emblem* characters, rather than with motivational posters.

* Map variety is on the thinner side, with about 75% of the missions tasking players to simply defeat all of the opponents units. <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Moving all of your units in one blob at a time, sticking out a single high-defense unit to lure enemies in.'">"Turtling"</text-with-tooltip> is a viable strategy for almost every map (unlike *Conquest*, which would heavily punish you for it), which makes things a little stale towards the end.

* Aside from resource management (which I think is fun, but I can easily see how some players might find it monotonous), every single activity at <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'The game\s hubworld. Players return to it after every battle.'">the Somniel</text-with-tooltip> is a waste of time. The activities and minigames are unfun, take *far* too long, and the rewards are not worth the time spent. For example, I completely ignored the little cat thing since petting it and feeding it forces players into an mandatory 15-second cutscene *every time*. *WHY are they not skippable???*

* As mentioned above, while most of the game's character designs are simply silly (I actually *like* [Timerra's design!](https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/Timerra)), some designs border on ridiculous. Why is [Ivy](https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/Ivy) wearing a *cage* on her face? Was [Celine](https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/C%C3%A9line) modeled after a cupcake? Why does [Panette](https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/Panette) look like [Jack Skellington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Skellington)?

<div class="imageContainer">

  <span class="text--secondary">And for my final question: why are her boobs vacuum-sealed to her dress? Does double-sided sticky tape exist in the Fire Emblem universe?</span>

## The Ugly Stuff

### Information Management and Discovery
As I said above: the issues above are annoyances, and depending on kind of player you are, some may be more egregious than others.

But one major issue with *Engage* that doesn't seem to be present in online discourse is how *poor* the game's information management is. For a game where players need to know as much about the current battle as possible, I'm honestly shocked by how much *Engage* regresses in this area.

For comparison's sake, let's start by taking a look at *Fire Emblem: Awakening*, a game released in 2012 on the 3DS.

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/awakening.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">Despite the low resolution, notice how absolutely jam-packed <i>Awakening's</i> interface is with useful info right at the player's fingertips. <a src="https://discoveringgamedesign.wordpress.com/2015/02/13/closer-look-fire-emblem-awakenings-interface/">Image Credit: Discovering Game Design</a></span>
</div>

[This awesome blog post](https://discoveringgamedesign.wordpress.com/2015/02/13/closer-look-fire-emblem-awakenings-interface/), which deserves its own read, goes into great detail about how *Awakening* made full and excellent use of the 3DS's dual screens. Enemy and player units are clear and distinct, unit stats/weapons/skills are organized and accessible, and with the tap of the screen, the entire map can be displayed to get a general sense of player/enemy positioning. As an added UX flourish, *anything* can be tapped on to reveal more information. Want to be reminded about what Dexterity does, or the effect of a certain skill? Simply tap on it to reveal a tooltip explaining exactly that. For most humans <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'If you\'re able to remember all 6 modifiable skills for every unit ON TOP OF the skills that Emblems grant, then congrats, you\'re smarter than me.'">with average INT stats</text-with-tooltip>, such a feature is invaluable.

Put simply, not once while playing *Awakening* did I find it difficult to quickly get the information I needed to confidently make decisions.

Now, let's look at *Engage*. Let's say that I want to remind myself what abilities a particular unit has. Here's how I'd do that:

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/scroll.webp'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary"></span>
</div>

To figure out what the right-most ability does, I need to select the unit, press X, and the scroll *all the way* to the right. For those counting at home, that is **14** button presses. 

To answer clever readers that might be thinking, "well, obviously you're playing in *Docked* mode! Surely you can tap on the interface while undocked!", then I'd agree with you: that would be an *perfectly sufficient* compromise. But no, *Fire Emblem: Engage* for the Nintendo Switch, featuring an OLED 6-inch touchscreen, does *not* utilize the touch screen.

Confusingly, the interface also omits certain stats, such as Dexterity, Dodge, and Luck, the first two being *really* important in the latter half of the game. To view these stats, one has to press the "-" button (which is seldom used in most Switch games), which triggers a 2 second transition to a *different* screen that *replaces* the overhead view. Take a look:

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/stats.jpg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">If you need to be reminded as to what "Luck" does, you'll have to press "Down" about 20 times.</span>
</div>

Great, I can view the unit's stats, but now I can't see the battlefield anymore. What was I doing again? What kinds of enemies is this unit near? Context-switches like these are especially disruptive for a game that is mostly cerebral.

Let's play a different game: in the screenshot below, which unit hasn't yet been moved?

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/feint.jpg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">There is not nearly enough of a distinction between units, which is exacerbated when moved units become gray-tinted.</span>
</div>

The answer is: the unit left of the selected unit (Timerra). But how long did it take you to find him? If you're like me, then the answer is "way too long".

This highlights another issue: why do character models (especially when grayed-out) look so *similar* to each other? As I mentioned earlier, *Engage* is, thankfully, much more visually clear than *Three houses*, but both pale in comparison to *Awakening's* incredibly distinct 2D sprites.

And to be clear, this is not merely an aesthetic complaint: during my time with *Engage*, I would often misidentify my flying units, thinking I was moving one with high resistance when I was actually moving a unit with *low* resistance (i.e. Hortensia vs Rosado). This would often lead to cheap, frustrating, and ultimately avoidable deaths.

There are countless other complaints I could levy about this game's interface. For example, the game's minimap display, which used to occupy a bottom screen in previous games, now has three options: hidden, uselessly ant-sized, or gigantically-obtrusive. Couldn't they have picked some middle ground, or allowed players to fiddle with its opacity? And why does the minimap not differentiate between moved and unmoved units? Coupled with a camera that is either way too zoomed in or way too zoomed out, the *Engage's* minimap is practically useless.

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/stats2.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">Why does Alear have a +2 speed modifier? It will cost you 11 button presses to figure out that valuable piece of information.</span>
</div>

In case it's not clear, for a game that requires players to have a keen sense on where units are, which abilities and weapons they're equipped with, and what their strengths and weaknesses are, these UI/UX issues are *unacceptable*. Sure, previous games in the series had two screens to work with, but surely they could have thought of *something* better than what was implemented. 

In summary, for a game on a console with *far* more pixels than a 3DS, DS, or even a GBA, this game has far too many issues with its UI, and I hope that these issues will be addressed in future installments.  

### The Story
My final major gripe with this game is its narrative. Or more specifically, its lack of one.

Let me start with an example. Very minor spoilers below:

Picture all of your units, along with their Emblems, <span class="spoiler">pledging their lives to fight one final battle. Some have been undyingly loyal from day one, while others have acquiesced to fate, recognizing that differences must be set aside in order to save the world. The fate of the world rests upon this moment, and no one is taking it lightly.</span>

<span class="spoiler">As your units stand steadfast, the music swells in intensity while the main villain snarls one final vicious, yet despondent, insult, as if your very existence is nothing but a hinderance.</span> Finally, as the battle starts, the game's main theme song cuts through the melodrama to kick the action into high-gear.

<youtube-link :src-link="'https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MNJqgyNgCYA?si=k9Rnx5R07acBrGW0&amp;start=59'">Without lyrics, the game's main theme is actually really cool.</youtube-link>

I ain't gonna lie: this was an awesome moment. It genuinely felt intense, exciting, and (I can't believe I'm saying this) inspiring as I pondered, for the final time, how best to prepare for what seemed like impossible odds. It was the highest point in my entire playthrough, and stands as a shining example of what games in this genre should aspire to achieve.

So, how does this square with my complaint about *Engage's* narrative? Well, it's because this moment occurs *right before the end of the game*. It's the one and only time that *Engage* had elicited those feelings from me. The rest of the game evoked nothing from me.

In other words, it takes roughly 40-60 hours for *Engage* to give the player any sense of purpose, or for the narrative to gain any kind of tension or drama. This is *far* too long.

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/cutscene.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">The pre-rendered cutscenes are nice, but are very few and far between. <a src="https://www.thumbculture.co.uk/fire-emblem-engage-switch-review">Image Credit: Thumb Culture</a></span>
</div>

I think the main problem with *Engage's* story is that it follows a dreadfully-predictable formula based on recruitment: players are linearly shuffled around to the world's various countries in order to recruit units. At each country, the local royal figures are threatened somehow by evil, and it's up to the player to stop them, culminating in some of them joining our cause.

I hate it when <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Both Zelda games on the Switch are prime examples of this: nothing of interest happens in either game until all four guardians are recruited.'">games</text-with-tooltip> telegraph this "recruitment" based narrative structure because it makes it *very* clear to the player that absolutely nothing of significance will happen until all X characters/crystals/whatever are collected. In *Engage's* case, as soon as I landed in Firene and saw that there were 3 more countries on the map, I knew exactly how things were going to go. 

And sure enough, I was right. Nothing of importance happens for the first 20 chapters (save for maybe chapter 14). Instead, the player is whisked from location to location, meeting characters that have no impact on the story.

These recruitment stories aren't always a death sentence for player engagement: some games manage to get away with it by giving each recruit their own localized, personal conflicts. Mass effect, for example, handles this by dedicating a *lot* of time to these new characters' smaller conflicts, and then smartly integrates them into the story at large in exciting and unexpected ways (i.e. Wrex and the "Genophage" in Mass Effect 2).

Unfortunately, *Engage* spectacularly fails at generating any interest at all in these new recruits. As units join the player's army, they're given about 5 minutes of screen time until they're whisked away to permanently live in the game's menus, never to be heard from again aside from the occasional anime chirp (i.e. "Divine Dragon, please believe in yourself!"). Sure, they're happy to chatter away during support conversations, but aside from a <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'For some reason, the game reserves intrigue and nuance exclusively for it villain-esque characters, such as Zephia, Ivy, and Hortensia. As a result, they (along with oddball Yunaka) are far more interesting than the rest of the cast.'">few exceptions</text-with-tooltip>, these optional cutscenes do little more than establishing that "this one likes to exercise", or "this one wants to be cute".

<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/supports.webp'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">Gee, I wonder what the chef-looking character that loves to cook will talk to me about?</span>
</div>

I can somewhat sympathize with *Engage's* writers: how do you weave new characters into a game's plot when almost each and every one of them <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'The Fire Emblem series is somewhat famous for its permadeath design: when characters are defeated on the battlefield, they\'re typically gone for good.'">can be killed</text-with-tooltip>? How do you give depth to a character when the game's design basically prevents it?

If the series wants to cling to its perma-death design, then I don't think that this is a problem that can be solved. The only thing that I can think of is to potentially decrease the number of recruitable units so that the game can spend more time with the ones that already exist. 

But regardless of why, the end result is that *Engage's* narrative loses steam *very* quickly because its characters fail to generate any sort of interest or intrigue. And I've said this before: without compelling characters, there is no *story*. There's just things that happen.

To its credit, *Engage* does hint at something deeper with its characters: <span class="spoiler">What exactly happened during the war 1000 years ago? What series of events concerning the "Foundational Emblem" led to Sombron's campaign of destruction? Why is Zephia so desperate for a family, and what led to the formation of the Four Hounds?</span>.

But unfortunately, none of these questions are <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'It\'s possible that the DLC delves into this, but a $60 game shouldn\'t require additional purchases in order to make a narrative whole.'">ever answered</text-with-tooltip>, and we're left with *implications* of a larger, more expansive narrative without it ever being delivered. Instead, *Engage* is content with telling (rather than showing) us about all these supposedly important events that happened 1000's of years ago, foolishly believing that a bit of offscreen exposition is enough to get players invested in it's story. Obviously, it's not.

Nevertheless, this is precisely *why* I wanted to begin this section with that single example of a time where *Engage's* narrative was thrilling and tense; it suggests that it's possible for a *Fire Emblem* game to be both mechanically *and* narratively interesting.

But unfortunately, this example also highlights how disappointing the rest of the game's story is. *Engage's* narrative could have been great, but it's perhaps one of the blandest, uninteresting stories in the entire series (and I've played *Fates*, which is routinely mocked for its terrible story).

## Conclusion

</div>

With all of that said (goddamnit, why am I so bad at keeping these reviews succinct?), I can confidently state that absolutely nobody plays *Fire Emblem* games for their stories. Indeed, not a single person on this planet has ever uttered the words, "I'm incredibly excited for the next Fire Emblem game's story!" Rather, their stories are often complimentary to what is already a deep and addicting experience.

In conclusion, I suppose this review *can* be summed up as:

<info-box :source-name="'Nevermeant.dev'" :source-link="'https://opencritic.com/game/13896/fire-emblem-engage'">
The story and characters suck, but the gameplay is amazing. Three House's social elements were a waste of time, so less of that is also good. 8/10.

In all seriousness, I hope this review has either nudged prospective players of *Engage* closer to a decision, or provided some interesting points to consider for those that have already played this game.

(One final note: not a single *Engage* pun can be found in this review. I'm incredibly proud of myself for that.)

(Another final note: maybe I *should* play *Three Houses*...)

**Verdict: 4 Critical Hits out of 5**
