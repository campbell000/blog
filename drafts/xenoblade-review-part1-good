## Disclaimers
* This 
* I completed the entire game and finished the many of the game's sidequests. This took me about 100 hours.
* I am a *huge* fan of Xenoblade Chronicles 1 and 2 (despite how flawed the latter turned out to be).

## Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Punctuates Nintendo's Venerated Series
Almost 5 years after the relase of Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 (henceforth referred to as "XC3") is finally here. As the third game the Xenoblade Chronicles series, its director [was quoted as saying](https://nintendoeverything.com/monolith-soft-shares-xenoblade-chronicles-3-message-another-tease-of-the-future/) that this game can be considered the end of the story that started with <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'The events of Xenoblade 1 and 2 were kicked off by Klaus, a power-hungry scientist that activated a poorly-understood technological artifact that ended up splitting the universe in two.'">Klaus' experiment,</text-with-tooltip> but not the end of the Xenoblade series. In other words, "a stopping point". A resting place. A period in which the team and the fans can gather their thoughts, reflect on past experiences, and ponder where the series will go next. Xenoblade is not gone, but it's likely to go away for a while.

So, as ~the conclusion~ a "stopping point" for this beloved JRPG series, how does Xenoblade Chronicles 3 fare? 

Given that Xenoblade Chronicles 3 takes a minimum of [62 hours to beat](https://howlongtobeat.com/game/103825), which doesn't include the 30-40 hours of additional content, there's no way that I'd be able to answer that question in a two-page essay. And since [game reviewers don't need to finish games anymore](https://twitter.com/raveofravendale/status/1496533451096440838?lang=en), a long-form review of this game <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'No, I don\'t think game reviewers need to kill themselves to complete game in 24 hours to review it. But wouldn\'t you raise an eyebrow if I told you that I read through 65% of George Orwell\'s novel 1984, and flatly told you that it sucks?'">doesn't seem to exist.</text-with-tooltip>

So, much like Xenoblade Chronicles 3 itself, I'm going to take *way too long* to explain to you what I think and how I feel. I suppose I could consider this long review as revenge for the time I wasted playing Xenoblde Chronicles 3. This game is certainly a ride, but it's not necessarily a fun one from start to finish.

Let's get started.

## Outstanding in Many Respects
It goes without saying that <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'While it\'s difficult to determine their exact contribution, Monolithsoft had a significant hand in Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I theorize that they were tapped for their expertise in open-world games, showcased excellently in Xenoblade Chronicles on the Wii.'">Monolithsoft's work on Nintendo's consoles is unparalleled</text-with-tooltip>: the environments in Xenoblade Chronicles 1 pushed Nintendo's aging Wii console to its limits, and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 offered Nintendo Switch fans a glimpse into what Nintendo's new console was capable of, upping the ante from Xenoblade 1 in many respects.

It's no surprise, then, that Xenoblade Chronicles 3 continues that trend.

### A Stunning Technical Achievement
<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/xc3gif.JPG'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">Xenoblade Chronicles 3 occasionally makes you forgot that you're playing a game on an mobile processor from 2017. This game's technical and artistic aspects are, at times, execeptional.</span>
</div>

Both artistically and technically, this game is leaps and bounds ahead of anything else on the Switch. Simply compare the screenshot above to this screenshot of  <a target="_blank" href="/pokemon.jpg">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</a>. That comparison should speak for itself.

The landscapes are vast, the character models are detailed and expressive, <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Xenoblade Chronicles 2\'s lighting system gave characters an awful plastic-looking shine. Xenoblade 3\'s lighting system gives character models a much more realistic-looking glow.'">the lighting system is greatly improved</text-with-tooltip>, and there is a significant increase in the number of onscreen characters and enemies. More impressive is the fact that, despite all of these improvements, I noticed very little <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'LOD (level-of-detail) culling involves using a lower-detailed version of that object when the object is far from the player\'s view. The idea is that the player won\'t notice, thereby conserving computing power for objects that the player can actually see.'">pop-in and LOD culling</text-with-tooltip> that many games nowadays tend to use and abuse.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xcneon.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">In addition to the game's technical chops, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 makes intelligent use of neon colors to make environments pop.</span>
</div>

These improvements aren't simply for the pixel-counters and the framerate snobs, though. Instead, I'd argue that these improvements help Xenoblade Chronicles 3 feel like a *real, living universe*. It's biomes are teeming with personality and life, which helps evoke a nostalgic, childlike sense of adventure. Part of the Xenoblade Chronicles series' appeal is its stunning, varied environments, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3 definitely delivers.

This is important because exploration is a large part of Xenoblade Chronicles 3's appeal: much of the player's time will be spent traversing the game's varied, ethereal landscapes. Despite a lack of any real secrets to discover or treasures to find (which I'll get to later), I'll admit that simply being able to observe the <a target="_blank" href="/xc3vista.gif">sun setting behind a vast expanse of distant mountains </a>for the first time was a real treat.

### A Mature, Consistent Narrative
<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/xcstory.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">XC3's dedication to its grim world and mature characters make the stakes feel real, rather than contrived.</span>
</div>

Let's talk about Xenoblade Chronicles 2, this game's predecessor, for a second. Xenoblade Chronicles 2's critical reception was divisive in many respects, but one common criticism was that the game was "too anime". Even though <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'It implies that anime is inherently childish and silly. Yes, anime meant for children and teens can be silly and obnoxious, but anime exists for many demographics. There are houndreds of anime shows that are thoughtful, mature, and nuanced.'">I take issue with this phrase,</text-with-tooltip> I mostly agree with the sentiment: despite Xenoblade 2's attempts to establish a complex narrative that spans multiple universes, its efforts are undermined by the game's proclivity for [fanservice](https://gintendo-namer.squarespace.com/articles/2018/2/5/xenoblade-the-sjw-article), [penis jokes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMBRC1dHALY), [accidental boob touching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc-u936MOB4), and [ridiculoud-looking outfits](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/xenoblade/images/6/64/XC2_Pyra_artwork.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20171110014440). This is made worse by a shoddy North American localization and some <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Alledgedly, the terrible performances are due to the voice actors and actresses being rushed, as well as being given little/no direction as to the appropriate tone for a scene. I can believe that.'">absolutely *terrible* voice acting performances</text-with-tooltip>, which ensures that any attempts at humor land with a thud.

I'm not here to shame people for enjoying sexiness and silliness, but for a series like Xenoblade Chronicles, scenes like this are incongruous with the seriousness of the game's conflict. Is this an epic sci-fi novel, or a harem-style romantic comedy?

Xenoblade Chronicles 3, thankfully, swings the pendulum back towards Xenoblade 1's more-mature tone (and maybe even further). Speaking to Nintendo, the game's developers had this to say about the character design process: 

<info-box :source-name="'Ask the Developer Vol. 6, Xenoblade Chronicles 3–Part 2'" :source-link="'https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-6-xenoblade-chronicles-3-part-2/'">
[S]ince the story is more serious than the previous titles, we designed the characters to look more mature by making them taller. We also designed the costumes to be not too flashy to match the tone of the story. [...] We asked Saito-san to tailor the overall design, including the clothing, to a dignified style that fits a serious story. 
</info-box>

Look no further for proof of this darker tone than the game's opening cutscene: as battles between Agnus and Keves soldiers rage on, the player is forced to bear witness to this war's terrible consequences. Rotting corpses and wounded soldiers litter the battlefield as soliders celebrate a brief, temporary victory, only to be forced to fight again tomorrow. <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Well, as gruesome as it can possibly be for a T-rated game.'">It's a gruesome sight</text-with-tooltip>, reminding players that in the world of Aionios, there are no winners. Instead, this pointless conflict ensures that everyone loses.

This war-torn, dystopian world has clearly taken its toll on the game's main cast, who are afflicted with bouts of anxiety, despair, and hopelessness. Despite its fantasy setting, Xenoblade Chronicles 3's characters endure struggles that may be all-too-familiar to the player (feelings of inadequacy, a fear of death, etc), making their struggles feel real and, perhaps, personal.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xc3sad.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Helped by a mature script and mostly-great voice acting, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 makes its characters' problems feel real and relatable.</span>
</div>

In general, unlike Xenoblade Chronicles 2, this game never fails to remind the player that the stakes of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 are high: the world is inherently cruel, and innocent people are suffering.

That's not to say it's *all* doom and gloom, though. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 smartly breaks things up by sprinkling bits of levity throughout its narrative. But again, unlike Xenoblde Chronicles 2, these moments don't feel out of place in an epic sci-fi adventure. Instead, these moments lend humanity to the main cast of characters as they try to make light of a terrible existence. 

In that sense, it's refreshing to see Monolithsoft take its universe a little more seriously, and I'd argue that those efforts paid off in a more compelling, more believable narrative.

### An Unwieldy, But Incredibly Rewarding, Battle System
<div class="imageContainer imageUnderSection">
  <img :src="'/xc3battle.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">This screenshot will probably look bewildering to those unfamiliar with Xenoblade. There's lots to learn about XC3's battle system, but in my opinion, it's worth learning.</span>
</div>

I've dedicated most of this review so far to the game's environments and narrative. This is because you'll spend about half of your playtime exploring, watching, and listening. This is a *good* thing, since I'd argue that the game's world is interesting and complex.

But the other half of your playtime will either be spent battling, or preparing for battle. Let me explain.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3's battle system is complicated. Perhaps maybe a little *too* complicated. It builds off of Xenoblade 1 and 2's systems, so I can't speak to how intimiding and confusing it might be for a new player, but I *can* say that it's one of the most complicated battle systems in any game that I've played. In addition, the game introduces new wrinkles and features into the battle system as the player progresses, so I'd argue that a player likely won't feel comfortable with the battling until about half-way through the game.

But while that sounds like a negative thing, I'd argue that this actually *helps* the player come to grips with the wonderful flexibility that the game has to offer. Things are <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Well, relative to how complicated the battle system gets by the end of the game.'">relatively simple</text-with-tooltip> at first: the game teaches you how to auto-attack, how to use Arts (special moves that deal more damage), and other basic mechanics (swapping characters, equipping accessories, leveling up, etc). If you've played a JRPG before, the basics will click fairly quickly.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xc3sena.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Xenoblade Chroincles 3's menus smartly hide much of the game's complexity in sub-menus, which gives players the option to either quickly scan the important stuff, or dive into the finer nuances of each characters abilities, stats, and equipment.</span>
</div>

Then, one by one as you progress, the game introduces more mechanics: <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'abilities that you can learn from and borrow from other classes'">Master Artes and Master Skills</text-with-tooltip>, <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Performing two Artes at the same time, combining their effects'">Fusion Artes</text-with-tooltip>, <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Super-powered forms that characters can assume for a limited time'">Oroborous Forms</text-with-tooltip>, and <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Stops time and allows players to attack enemies repeatedly'">Chain Attacks</text-with-tooltip>. I'll admit that the game's constant use of made-up RPG jargon got overwhelming at times, and despite the game offering an abunadnce of tutorials to ease players into these new mechanics, I'd often not fully grasp <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'It took me several hours to realize that the the Ouroboros forms were effectively “Oh Shit! Don\'t Die!” buttons. '">the point of a mechanic</text-with-tooltip> until several hours later. And yes, Xenoblade Chronicles 2's constant tutorials, [famously memed on by Dunkey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiVZMxf4E2Q), are back to relentlessly annoy players for the first 20 hours.

But after about 20 hours, something awesome happened: the mental burden of Xenobalde Chronicles 3's numerous mechanics began to ease, and I started to view these mechanics as tools instead of a source of confusion. 

What do I mean by this? Well, to give you some examples: want to turn Eunie, one of the game's default healers, into a critical-hit landing powerhouse? How about a tank that is frail but impossible to hit? Or maybe you'd rather put her in a support role that has insane synergies with one of your other attackers?

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xc3class.jpeg'"/>
  <span class="text--secondary">Changing classes is a great way to alleviate some of the tedium of using the same skills and abilities over and over. Plus, it allows characters to learn skills that they wouldn't otherwise be able to use.</span>
</div>

In Xenoblade Chronicles 3, not only is this possible, but it's actively *encouraged*. The game rewards (and explicitly recommends) you to constantly change your characters' classes, and by doing so, they'll permanently learn skills and abilities from other classes. For example, if you change Lanz, the game's tank, to a healer class, they'll learn a healing skill that they can use *no matter what class you assign them*. Put simply, it's *fun and incredibly rewarding* to see how one character (say, a healer) might benefit from donning a different hat (say, an attacker's). Maybe they'll learn a skill that helps their healing artes have less cooldown, or maybe they'll learn a skill that can reduce agro?

One other notable feature is what the game calls "Fusion Artes". This mechanic allows players to perform two artes at once, and when doing so, any secondary effects of these artes are combined and amplified. 

For example, say you have an <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Area-Of-Effect. In other words, the attack hits all enemies in an area'">AOE</text-with-tooltip> arte, and an art that puts enemies to sleep. If you combine these two artes, the result would put *all enemies in the surrounding area to sleep*. 

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img :src="'/xc3fusion.jpg'"/>
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Xenoblade Chronicles 3's "Fusion Art" system opens the door for endless experimentation with each character's arts. While it can be a little overwhelming at first, it's incredibly satisfying to stumble on that perfect combination.</span>
</div>

The art fusions possibilities are endless. Want a fusion art that both <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'RPG-speak for an attack that ignores any damage reduction incurred from an enemy\'s defenses'">pierces</text-with-tooltip> and crits? Or how about a fusion art that can buff your team and debuff an enemy at the same time? What about a fusion art that heals *twice*? All of these combinations are fair game. 

And on one final note, the game doesn't *force* playes to deal with this complexity. When switching classes, the game helpfully sets some sensible defaults for arts, accessories, fusions, etc. So if you want total control of your team's composition, have at it! But if you'd rather not sweat the small stuff and just enjoy the ride, the game can handle that, too.

In short, yes, the game's mechanics are initially bewildering. But I'd argue that there's nothing quite like spending a good 20 minutes finding the perfect combination of classes and Arts, and then *beating the absolute shit* out of a previously-troublesome boss. These moments can be exhilirating, and servce to vindicate any initial struggles a player may have with the game's battle system.

### Miscellaneous Goodness
While I want avoid making this review 100 pages, it wouldn't be fair for me to not mention the following:

- As expected, Xenoblade Chronicles 3's soundtrack is phenomenal. It's unlike anything else I've heard in a videogame, with strong, memorable melodies that still evoke the fantastical and the surreal.
- While not perfect (in particular, Mio's performance is pretty poor), the voice acting from the main cast is *much* improved over its predecessor, sounding downright impressive at times.
- Loading screens are kept to an absolute minimum, only occurring when you travel to another zone. For example, fast-traveling within a zone incurs almost no loading. Combined with a snappy menu, it's a joy to play a <text-with-tooltip :tooltip="'Many games, including this game\'s predecessor, contain laggy, unresponsive menus that making even the simplest management actions a chore to perform.'">game that can actually keep with the player's inputs</text-with-tooltip>.
- In general, the game avoids a lot of the time-wasting nonsense that afflicts most other JRPGs, and contains many helpful quality-of-life features. This includes the auto-selling of items, the ability to immediately make changes and retry after a failed boss battle, and a generous navigation system that avoids a lot of the guesswork when trying to figure out where to go next.
