## Disclaimers
1. Do not direct any hatred at any employees of CDPR, or any of the other companies I mention in this post. 99% of the people that work at these companies likely just want to make good games.

2. With that said, buying these games because "you should feel sorry for the developers and support the industry" is simply perpetuating the problem and enabling these parasitic companies (i.e. EA, Activision-Blizzard) and the CEOs that infect them to continue exploiting passionate developers, artists, and designers.

3. This post is not outrage bait to hate on CDPR or Cyberpunk 2077. Please read the entire post before dismissing it as such.

## The Context
Ostenisbly, this post is about Cyberpunk 2077: if you've been out of the gaming loop for the past couple of weeks, you may have missed that the game's launch since December 10th has *absolute mess* (on consoles, anyway). Additionally, the way that CD Projekt Red (henceforth CDPR), the game's developer, has handled its development has disappointed and confused many people, especially those that had purchased and enjoyed The Witcher 3.

To my knowledge (I'm not a "game journo" so I don't have the inside scoopz), below is a rough timeline of important points and events concerning CDPR and the development of Cyperpunk 2077:

- Riding high from the success of The Witcher 3, beloved developer CDPR bragged on multiple occasions that their hip game dev studio [doesn't force their employees to "crunch"](https://kotaku.com/cd-projekt-red-boss-again-promises-that-cyberpunk-devs-1835518344), which is a cutesy name for the cruel practice of forcing mandatory, grueling overtime on their employees. It's common in the gaming industry.
- Cyberpunk 2077, being in development for [roughly 9 years](https://www.gfinityesports.com/article/8658/cyberpunk-2077-how-long-has-it-been-in-development-9-years), was set to release in August 2020, but then delayed to September, then to November.  The game was once again delayed to December, and in order to meet this deadline, [the studio went back on their word and forced their company into "crunch time"](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/09/30/cyberpunk-2077-devs-backtrack-on-no-mandatory-crunch-stance-report-claims/). Oops.
- Game review outlets [weren't allowed](https://twitter.com/skillupyt/status/1335999301382639618?lang=en) to use their own footage when writing reviews, and only PC copies of the game were sent to reviewers, despite the fact that [41% of the game's pre-orders were for consoles](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/cyberpunk-2077-refund.html), a metric the studio was surely aware of since pre-order statistics were likely similar. Many, many mainstream game review publications (IGN, gamespot) didn't do *nearly* enough to highlight this fact in their reviews, and showered the game with 9's and 10's.
- [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/), ever complicit in the vicious cycle of game industry/advertising corruption, listed Cyberpunk 2077 as having a 91 out of 100 in the Xbox and PS4 section at the time. This has since been changed, but the damage had been done.
- Unsurprisingly, the game was released in an [absolutely unacceptable state](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review-ps4-xbox-one-price-size-gameplay-2338569) on PS4 and Xbox One, despite those consoles being the initial primary targets for development. Surprisingly, the game also runs [pretty terribly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVWJPYKCMco) on PS4 Pro and Xbox One X, as well. The game runs OK-ish on PC, as long as you have great hardware.
- CD Projekt Red [apologizes](https://www.pcmag.com/news/cd-projekt-red-offers-apology-and-refunds-for-cyberpunk-2077) "for not showing you the game on base last-gen consoles". In other words, they're sorry for intentionally deceiving 41% of their customers, and getting blasted on the internet for it. They also have the nerve to call PS4/XO "last-gen" when the new consoles released just last month, and it's almost impossible to purchase a PS5 or Xbox Series X (they are sold out literally everywhere at the moment, except for absurdly high prices on amazon/ebay)
- In a move that should be illegal, but for some reason isn't, Microsoft and Sony are [refusing refunds](https://www.t3.com/us/news/cyberpunk-2077-ps4-and-xbox-players-fuming-as-sony-and-microsoft-refuse-refunds_) for the game, telling players to wait for patches. Patches that no one even knows what they'll contain or what they'll address. **UPDATE: in a rare win for the consumer, both companies are now offering refunds. This is likely to avoid legal scrutiny for not allowing digital refunds for all products, period, but a win is a win, I suppose**.

I think that covers most of it. If you can't tell, I don't quite buy the sincerity of their apology, nor do I think that this long list of mistakes can be boiled down to "aww shucks, guys, we really messed up! We'll strive to do better for our passionate fans next time!" 

Rather, I think that every single step that CDPR took was cold, calculating, and extractive, trying to exploit their employees and consumers as much as possible without caring whether or not their employees were well taken care of, or whether they could put out a product that they could confidently stand behind. Put simply, CDPR simply tried to cash a huge consumer-goodwill check, and that check bounced.

## From "Good Guy CDPR" To Bad Guy 
As I said above, at the surface, this post is about Cyberpunk 2077, but when you think about the gaming industry, the long bullet-point list above *is really nothing new*. Remember how badly we all hated (or currently hate) EA? Or Ubisoft? Or Activision-Blizzard? These companies' reputations have all been tarnished for similar reasons: they have abused the trust and goodwill of their customers by releasing buggy, broken, unfinished, or otherwise unrepresentative games.

With that said, then why has the internet's reaction to CDPR and Cyberpunk 2077 been so *visceral* and *emotional*? What makes this different from a typical EA or Activision-Blizzard blunder?

I think that the difference lies in **brand perception**. It's worth noting that companies spend millions of dollars in advertising to establish something known as a ["Brand Image"](https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/brand-image/), which is a term to describe how consumers associate ideas, feelings, and imagery to a brand. Getting this right is extremely important for the long-term success of a company. 

For example, what do you think of when I say "Activision-Blizzard"? For me, I see vivid imagery of landfills, cocaine, casinos, economic crisis, and depressed children. That probably makes Activision sad, but their actions over the years have cultivated those images in my head, so they've kinda dug their own grave on that one. 

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="" :src="'/kotick.png'" />
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">This actually happened. Taken from <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/aq3yql/beyond_scummy/">this reddit post</a></span>
</div>

CDPR, on the other hand, through sheer hard work and dedication to their craft ([and maybe some help](https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-gets-7-million-government/) from the Polish goverment), had managed to cultivate a much more positive brand image. If we were to repeat that brand-word-association exercise with CDPR before the release of Cyberpunk 2077, I'd imagine that the words that most gamers would come up with would be much more positive.

Therefore, CDPR and the release of Cyberpunk 2077 has made waves across the game industry not because "game company does scummy, anti-consumer thing" is newsworthy, but because CDPR had previously been perceived as "one of the good guys" among the faceless, soulless, and spineless EAs, Blizzards, and Ubisofts of the industry. If Cyberpunk 2077 were to be developed by EA, for example, most gamers would simply roll their eyes and cluck their tongues, chastising the young and naive for buying into the hype. But this was *CDPR*. They were *one of us*. I imagine that, for long time fans of the studio, Cyberpunk 2077's blunder felt like a deep betrayal from a long time friend.

So, why had CDPR been perceived as "one of the good guys" in the gaming industry?

Perhaps owing to its humble beginnings as a small Polish studio, CD Projekt Red managed to cement itself in the minds of gamers as a passionate, focused, and honest game company. To be fair to CD Projekt Red, that may be true for the majority of people working at that company. I have not personally played any of the games from The Witcher series, but I *do* know from second-hand accounts that The Witcher 3 is an amazing game, it has enjoyed a plethora of content updates, and has been continuously supported by the company for many years, which is in stark contrast to many mainstream titles where the devs simply go dark after a few years until the playerbase dwindles into nothing. 

And while The Witcher 1 and The Witcher 2 may not have been as successful, those that have played those games typically regard them as flawed-but-enjoyable experiences which exude passion and care. The mere fact that CDPR put out three entries in the series that took three games to find success is a testament of their dedication to the world and its characters that they've created.

But on December 10th, 2020, CDPR learned a hard lesson: **customer trust is very difficult to earn, but very easy to lose**.

For some reason, whoever is calling the shots over at CDPR must have slept through this class at whatever business school they went to, because this lesson is not new or difficult to understand. In addition, there are *many* prior examples of game companies going from beloved to hated, literally in the span of one game release: Bethesda (Fallout 76), Bioware (Mass Effect: Andromeda, or arguably, Mass Effect 3), Hello Games (No Man's Sky), Blizzard (the Diablo: Immortal Fiasco, or the Warcraft III fiasco), Bungie (Destiny). There are *many* case studies to learn from.

The Internet Historian's video on Fallout 76 is a hilarious, but also depressingly-detailed account on everything that went wrong with the game. If you haven't already, give it a watch.
</youtube-link>

Gamers are passionate, excitable, fickle, and eager. They are quick to buy into hype, but they are also quick to write off a company completely when they've been burned. 

And it seems that many are feeling burned by Cyberpunk's release, at least on consoles. And to be honest, I don't think anyone can argue that the release of Cyberpunk 2077 was an abuse of trust. Console gamers were promised an amazing, high-quality experience from an "honest", "passionate", "focused" developer that they could trust, but instead got a buggy, poorly-optimized, mess of a game. More importantly, they were deceived up until the launch date about the game's performance on consoles. If CDPR had been more upfront about the game's console-specific issues, or had delayed the console's release while launching on PC, things may had been different.

Time will tell us if CDPR's brand image survives this ordeal, but the sentiment that I've gleaned from comments online tells me that fans will be much more discerning and critical of the company in the future. And there's no one that CDPR can blame but themselves. They've gone from good guy to bad guy in the span of a few weeks.

## Feel the Wrath of the Gamer
With all of that said, why are companies consistently making mistakes that betray the trust that their customers have given them? Why are they throwing away their perceived "good guy" brand images so quickly and easily, when it's taken many of them years, or even decades, to cultivate?

One might argue that the correct answer is often the simplest: game companies simply don't care what gamers think, since outrage on the internet typically isn't representative of overall customer sentiment. Plus, people love to bitch and moan on the internet, but at the end of the day, they'll buy the latest AAA game like everyone else, right? Public outrage on the internet, in general, is typically short-lived, so I wouldn't blame game companies if they simply ignored it.

But I don't think I agree with the argument that game companies don't care what gamers think about them since, historically, negative gamer sentiment *has* been shown to have a significant impact on a game's financial success. For example, EA's Battlefront II in 2017 outraged many with it's **outright-disgusting implementation of the lootbox system (i.e. gambling) in a starwars game designed for children, released during the holiday season**. After facing significant backlash that even managed to reach mainstream media outlets like CNN and Fox News, they had this to say:

<info-box :source-name="'Tweet from EA\'s official Twitter Account'" :source-link="'https://twitter.com/EAStarWars/status/931332890717143040'">
It's clear that many of you feel there are still challenges in the design. We've heard the concerns about potentially giving players unfair advantages. And we've heard that this is overshadowing an otherwise great game. This was never our intention. Sorry we didn't get this right. We hear you loud and clear, so we're turning off all in-game purchases. We will now spend more time listening, adjusting, balancing, and tuning.
</info-box>

I don't have the numbers to back this up, but there's *no way* that EA would have turned off microtransactions for a **children's starwars game, released during christmas** unless they determined that the negative sentiment from gamers would have a significant long-term impact on their game's success and on their brand in general. Seriously, if all had gone according to plan, they could have made a *killing* off of this game, especially with how predatory the microtransaction model had been designed. Instead, at the last minute, they determined that the negative backlash was more important to address. That decision alone suggests that companies *do* care what gamers think, and that negative sentiment *does* have a significant financial impact on game companies.

## Short-Term Versus Long-Term
Instead, I think that companies make these kinds of consumer-hostile decisions because of a fundamental dissonance that affects many medium-to large game development companies: **the conflict between short-term gains versus long-term financial stability.**

That's not a profound statement (I am not a profound man), but let me elaborate on it, as I think one might be quick to boil it down to "companies that focus on short term gains are stupid!!". Instead, I think it's more nuanced than that, as both mindsets have value:
* **Short-Term Gain:** allows companies to remain financially agile. Allows them to acquire talent quickly. Gives companies a short-term safety net in the event of a financial hardship. Short-term gains are often more difficult to acquire, however, and often require riskier decisions to be made. May also damage brand image if these decisions don't work out.
* **Long-Term Stability:** ensures that the company has steady cash flow. Attracts the best talent (top talent can demand contracts that have stability and benefits built-in) and builds the best kind of brand image. Focusing too much on stability, however, makes it difficult to adapt and pivot when the market changes.

While many companies across many industries must grapple with the problem of balancing those two mindsets, I think that the gaming industry in particular is uniquely affected by this conundrum because, perhaps more than any other industry on earth, the game industry's customer base is both undyingly loyal and incredibly fickle.

While paradoxical at first glance, it makes sense when you think about the kinds of products that the game industry offers. No other industry sells a $60 product that can offer 10's, 100's or even 1000's of hours of enjoyment, professional-level storytelling and acting, and cutting edge technology and graphics. No other industry creates worlds and characters that we can both bond with *and* control. In my opinion, there's nothing on the market quite as engrossing or immersive as gaming. Passive forms of entertainment (i.e. movies, animation, etc) might be a close second, but I don't think movie fans, anime fans, or cartoon fans are quite as dedicated or passionate as gamers, and I think it's because gaming encompasses movies and animation, and also adds elements of interactivity and social connectivity. There's really nothing quite like it.

As a result, more than any other industry, the game industry's consumers (i.e. gamers) tend to get personally and emotionally attached to its products and the companies that sell them. Other industries would *kill* for a customer base as loyal, proud, and dedicated as gamers. 

<div class="imageContainer">

  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">A pic from Super Smash Con 2019, a convention where people get together from around the world to play Super Smash Bros.

</div>

But the flipside to this unique quirk of the gaming industry's customer base is that, because gamers can be so personally and emotionally involved in a company and its products, they can feel personally betrayed when that company makes decisions that are consumer-hostile. So it's especially important that game companies are aware that gamers tend to have an especially-low tolerance for being mistreated. It also doesn't help that gaming isn't a necessity, so unlike cars or appliances, a jilted gamer can simply stop buying your products. Or worse: since gaming concepts aren't copyrightable, gamers can simply find a game that looks or plays similarly from another company.

In a perfect world, this wouldn't be an issue, as the people making games would typically be gamers themselves. Or at the very least, they'd understand and empathize with how passionate and invested gamers can be about these games and these companies. So in this perfect world, game companies wouldn't normally piss off their customers to the point where they'd feel emotionally betrayed.

But the harsh reality is that the gaming industry is a [$160,000,000,000 industry](https://www.reuters.com/article/esports-business-gaming-revenues-idUSFLM8jkJMl). There's far too many people in this world that can't and won't let all of that potential money simply sit there, unearned. So, people that don't *give a shit* about making great games enter the gaming industry with the intent of taking some of that money for themselves. Gaming is no longer your fun little obscure hobby, and it hasn't been that way for a long time. [It's a business, man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do3iJ6DWvpQ). 

As a result, for many medium-to-large game companies where there's far too many middlemen for anything to be done efficiently and effectively, these kinds of non-gamers tend to be the ones making many of the decisions, while the people who *just want to make good freaking games* go unheard and ignored. And unfortunately, the people that don't care about gaming also don't understand what it means to be personally invested in a game, a franchise, or a game company. 

These people likely don't even *enjoy* videogames. For example, Activison-Blizzard's CEO, Bobby Kotick, said that he [never actually liked or played videogames](https://www.forbes.com/global/2009/0216/056.html?sh=168bb9d539e4) in a 2009 Forbes interview, something he has furiously backtracked and denied since then. People like Bobby, for example, they've likely never stared in awe at the sheer absurdity at Super Smash Brothers Ultimate's character select menu and marveled at the possibility that they could now have Sonic, Mario, Ryu and Cloud Fight to the death. They've never felt the rush of escaping The Maw in a lone Warthog at the end of Halo, right before the time ran out. They don't have fond memories of Warcraft III LAN parties every weekend, nor have they ever laughed uproariously while playing Jackbox Party with their non-gamer family.

<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="" :src="'/ssb.jpg'" />
  <span class="titleImageCaption text--secondary">Even if you don't enjoy Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, most can recognize the significance of having Mario, Sonic, Ryu, Megaman, and Cloud in the same game. Super Smash Bros is a wonderful, reverent celebration of gaming.</span>
</div>

I'm not saying that these non-gamers are bad people (well, Bobby Kotick actually *is* a bad person, but that's another article for another day), nor am I gate-keeping the term "gamer" to mean someone who has played an arbitrary amount of games. I'm simply pointing out that there's obviously a disconnect between the people making these short-sighted decisions, and the customers that they're supposed to be serving.

So, when a non-gamer has crunched the numbers and has determined that it makes financial sense to ship a broken game, or to make the next game in a beloved franchise a [mobile game instead of a proper PC/console release](https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/5/18064290/blizzard-diablo-immortal-reaction-explainer-blizzcon), or to [cancel an online Super Smash Tournament](https://gamecrate.com/opinion-nintendo-shutting-down-big-house-2020-heartless/26401) in the middle of a global pandemic because they're using a mod to play online, they've likely missed this crucial point: there's an emotional attachment to these games and these companies that these management CEO types don't get. They cannot empathize with these gamers or the emotional connections they have with their products, so they fail to accurately assign the correct weight to betraying their customers. As a result, the calculations and metrics that these CEO types love to rely on so much end up being totally off the mark.

Therefore, in the case of CDPR and Cyberpunk 2077, it's likely that the short-term voices won out over the long-term ones. The game needed to be out by christmas for what was I'm sure a much-needed cash-boost, and another delay would have likely been very costly. Therefore, I'm sure that, on paper, the numbers made sense to push the game out now and fix it later. 

But like I've been saying, CDPR failed to factor in the very-real, yet unquantifiable realities of the gaming industry: their customers had placed their trust in them, and for better or worse, "gamer trust" is a stronger, more-frenzied trust than any other kind of consumer trust. By failing to factor this into their decision making, they made the wrong call of prioritizing short-term gain, and now they've caused irreparable damage to their brand in the minds of their once-loyal fans. Factor in the Microsoft/Sony refund disaster, and now CDPR has a real problem on their hands.

In general, I think that many of these kinds of missteps can be boiled down to companies erroneously focusing too heavily on short-term profits at the detriment of the long-term health of their company, failing to take into account that these missteps are *especially terrible* when it comes to gamers and the gaming industry. 

## A Cautionary Tale
Despite what all of the jaded internet commenters on the internet say, I actually think that all of the outrage over Cyberpunk 2077 is a *good thing*. While it might feel cool to jeer at the outrage and think to yourself, "typical internet, always so outraged over everything. Relax, it's just a game", it's exactly that mentality that allows the *actually* evil companies like EA and Activision-Blizzard, etc, to get away with their behavior in the first place. These companies' entire business model depends exactly upon gamers' apathy and jadedness. Otherwise, if more people knew how exploitative these companies were, both in how they operate and how gambling-like their games are, there's no way that their business models would pass legal scrutiny for long.

On the contrary, I think that all of this outrage serves as a yet another warning to CDPR and other game companies that the trust of your customers should not be taken lightly. If respected and nurtured, gamers will buy your products as soon as you announce them, no matter the cost. They will do this until the end of time, and be incredibly happy doing so. They will write about your games, they will talk about your games, they will try to convince their friends to purchase your games. They will be the customer that keeps on giving.

But if you betray this customer, they may never come back. On the contrary, they will rage on the internet about it. They will complain to their friends and family about it. They will feel emotionally hurt, and will actively hate what your company stands for.

I hope that game companies, including CDPR, have started to realize this, because even though I've spent the last dozen paragraphs criticizing certain game companies, I don't want to see game companies fail. My intent with this post is to bring to light *why* they are failing, and how they can fix their relationships with their customers. I want to see more great games get made, I want to see more people playing games, and I want to see boundaries being pushed. 

But that can't happen if companies keep making the same grave mistake over and over again. So, listen up, EA's, CDPR's, and Nintendo's of the industry: pay attention to what unfolds after the CDPR Cyberpunk 2077 drama. Take notes on how customers felt betrayed and misled. Study how glaringly transparent it was when reviewers could only use trailer footage in their reviews. Review CDPR's apology it posted on Twitter, observe how much of a non-apology it was, and see how little effect it had it mollifying gamers' concerns.

Finally, compare and contrast CDPR's sales for Cyberpunk 2077 against the next game that they release. I bet it won't be pretty.
