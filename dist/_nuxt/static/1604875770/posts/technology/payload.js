Well, in the past few years, much like how people consume much of their music through music aggregation platforms like spotify and apple music, many people consume news and information through news aggregation platforms like facebook, apple news, and reddit. Unless it reaches somebody's front page with billions of upvotes and thousands of little gold and red badges and gifs and notifications plastered all over it, your average person (myself included) probably won't see it.
