Well, in the past few years, much like how people consume much of their music through music aggregation platforms like spotify and apple music, many people consume news and information through news aggregation platforms like facebook, apple news, and reddit. Or worse: sites like the washington post (not even going to link to them) or "},{type:b,tag:h,props:{href:"https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com",rel:[l,m,n],target:o},children:[{type:a,value:"Medium"}]},{type:a,value:".

I've even turned off my adblocker for some of these sites, something that I would "},{type:b,tag:p,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"never"}]},{type:a,value:" do for something like reddit or facebook.
