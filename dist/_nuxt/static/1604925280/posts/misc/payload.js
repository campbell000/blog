Arguments about music fidelity aside, I can definitely see the appeal: compared to music-streaming services like spotify, you actually own the music, and the artist will actually make a couple bucks off of your purchase, as opposed to the fraction of the penny they'll make from spotify. And when compared to CDs, cassette tapes function as neat little display pieces, with tiny little labels and pieces of artwork you can display around your apartment.

"}]},{type:a,value:d},{type:b,tag:h,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"So how does this relate to starting a blog in 2020? Well, in the past few years, much like how people consume much of their music through music aggregation platforms like spotify or youtube\u002Fapple music, many people consume news and information through news aggregation platforms like facebook, apple news, and reddit. Unless it reaches somebody's front page with billions of upvotes and thousands of little gold stars all over it, your average person (myself included) probably won't see it. So in a way, a blog is kind of like a cassette tape: both are mediums of content with very limited appeal in 2020."}]},{type:a,value:d},{type:b,tag:h,props:{},children:[{type:b,tag:l,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"But that sucks"}]},{type:a,value:". Much like how music aggregation services harm music artists (low pay, only the big boys at the top benefit from this system), content aggregation services harm content creators: no one benefits except for the big, dominant voices (apple, NBCXfinityWarnerIHop, washington post, etc). Like most other human beings on the planet, I want to engage in discourse. I want to discuss, debate, listen, and learn. And I'm beginning to feel less and less comfortable doing so on platforms that are designed to stamp out voices like my own. And on top of that, these platforms are ultimately data-collection\u002Fadvertising-platforms first, and content-platforms second, which is "},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"creepy as hell"}]},{type:a,value:". So instead of writing another reddit post, or sharing something on facebook or stackoverflow, I've starting selling my own cassette tapes of tech content (except nothing on this site will ever be monetized!).
