Well, the term \"unix-like\" should give the answer away: in my opinion, MacOS is NOT a substitute for developing, building, and testing on a real linux distribution. If your target platform is a mac, then great, write all of your code and build scripts on a mac. But if your target platform is linux, much of the code you've written to build out and maintain your environment (i.e. install libraries, configure databases, etc) will not be portable to your actual application servers.

Unless it reaches somebody's front page with billions of upvotes and thousands of little gold stars all over it, your average person (myself included) probably won't see it.
