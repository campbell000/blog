# Never Meant Source Code
Hi. Here's the source code for my blog.

## Todo
- Add Comments
- Improve styles, readability
- Abandon Vuetify
  - The style is nice, but it's introduced way, way too many problems.
  - I've needed to make the changes to node_moduls files until this PR gets merged: https://github.com/nuxt-community/vuetify-module/pull/393/files
  - Why does strikethrough syntax no longer work? I.e. ~~?
