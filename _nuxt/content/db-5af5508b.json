I don't develop self-driving software for a living. I'm just a programmer. But I *have* taken a few machine-learning courses. And I've also [written a self-teaching Super Smash Brothers Bot using Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLwrLrBcj8&t=95s). So I'm not an expert, and I'm approaching this topic from a practical persecptive, and not an academic one, but I think I have enough of an understanding to help complete beginners write their first Deep Learning program. If you find yourself intrigued by this post, I encourage you to do more in-depth research on your own!\n\n## What is Deep Learning\nIf you've stumbled upon the term, \"Deep Learning\", then congratulations! You're one step closer to disambiguating the difference between \"Machine Learning\" and \"Deep Learning\". The side-effect of technology permeating pop culture (i.e. self-driving cars, virtual assistants, etc) is that the term \"Machine Learning\" tends to be used as a catch-all term for \"the computer is acting smart, and I can't explain why\".\n\nSo, the very fact that you're trying to figure out, exactly, what Deep Learning is means that you've detected some kind of fundamental difference. And there certainly is. Or rather, Deep Learning can be thought of as a subset of Machine Learning concepts.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img class=\"limitedSmall\" :src=\"'/MLdiagram.jpg'\" />\n    <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">Deep Learning shares many similarities to traditional machine learning, has its own unique traits. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning\">Taken From Here</a></span>\n</div>\n\n**So What's Different About Deep Learning?** These next paragraphs are a massive oversimplification, but to blithely summarize years worth of research, the biggest difference is that in traditional machine learning, you (meaning humans) would need to identify the important aspects, or \"features\" of an algorithm for the the machine to learn from by hand. \n\nFor example, if you were to design a system to learn how to recognize images of cats using traditional ML algorithms, you would need gather your cat-gineers in a room and decide what kinds of cat-ecteristics your system would need to learn and detect, such as\n- Does it have whiskers?\n- Does it have ears?\n- Does it have a tail?\n- Is it a dog instead of a cat? \n\nFor this simple cat-based task, constructing such a list would be pretty time-consuming, but for non-trivial tasks like automated self-driving vehicle tasks, it would be impossible. But let's say we wanted to do it anyway for this cat-detecting task. The final list would stil be prone to error: how would we be able to distinguish cats from tigers? Dogs from Cats? Yellow Cats from Lions? The list goes on. For humans, this task of \"feature engineering\" is a very difficult one.\n\n**Deep Learning seeks to address this pain-point by being able to \"auto-magically\" determine which features of the image were important for recognizing cats**. It can even derive features that we, as humans, may not even think of that are useful in it's cat-detecting task. \n\nHow can it do this? It can perform something called \"Feature Exaction\" through the use of some clever algorithms and an important data structure called a \"Neural Network\",  which is explained in the next section. The end result is that, instead of humans having to decide how to pick apart the pixels of an image to determine if it's a cat, the raw image can be fed into the algorithm.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img class=\"\" :src=\"'/machine-learning-vs-deep-learning.png'\" />\n    <span class=\"titleImageCaption\">Deep Learning handles the time-consuming and error-prone task of feature extraction for us. <a href=\"https://semiengineering.com/deep-learning-spreads/\">Taken From Here</a></span>\n</div>\n\n## Neural Networks As the Building Block for Deep Learning\nDespite the recent hype surrounding them, [Neural Networks are not newly-invented data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_neural_networks). But they've become powerful tools for solving problems only until recently because their usefulness hinges upon two things:\n\n1. Having lots and lots of data\n2. Being able to compute lots of mathematical operations in parallel\n\nI'd argue that perfect storm of cheap storage, readily-available parallel-compute units (i.e. GPUs), and scalable computing like AWS and Azure made the early 2010's the perfect time for Neural Networks to make a comeback.\n\n### What are Neural Networks\nSimply put, Neural Networks are data structures made up of three components:\n1. Nodes\n2. Edges\n3. Layers\n\nThe images below shows a small example Neural Network, showcasing these three components in action:\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img class=\"limitedMedium\" :src=\"'/NN.jpeg'\" />\n    <span class=\"titleImageCaption\">A Simple Neural Network with and Input Layer, Two Hidden layers and an Output layer (from left to right). <a href=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/02/neural-networks-intuition.html\">Taken from Here</a></span>\n</div>\n\nThe input layer consists of the three yellow nodes on the left, and they all have edges pointing to each one of the nodes in the next layer, and so on and so forth, until they all reach the final output layer on the right.\n\nTo understand how the model works, you need to understand a little bit of the math behind it (I'll keep it light and brief, so I'm simplifying things a little, here): starting at the input layer (which could represent anything, like RGB pixel values of a cat, audio data, etc. it just needs to be able to be represented numerically), this is what happens:\n1. An input node receives a value\n2. It sends it's value to all other nodes in the next layer\n3. Before the value reaches a particular nodes in the next layer, the value is multiplied by that specific node-to-node edge-weight (**this is important**)\n4. The receiving node sums all of the values it's received, and passes the value onto all of the nodes in the next layer (a simplification but enough for now)\n5. Do this for all nodes, for all layers, until we reach the output.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img class=\"limitedMedium\" :src=\"'/sample_nn.png'\" />\n    <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">A very simple network. See below on how to compute the output</span>\n</div>\n\nTake the network above as an example. Let's say we have \"3\" as an input. To compute the output, here's what would happen:\n- The top node would receive `3 * 2 = 6`\n- The bottom node would receive `1 * 3 = 3`\n- The output node would receive `(3 * 2) + (6 * 3) = 24`\n\nWe used whole number for our example, but for many problems, fractions and percents are used to express probabilities (i.e. an output might be expressed as a number between 0 and 1 to determine the system's confidence that an image is a cat).\n\nThis might seem completely ridiculous: how will a trivial model like that be able to solve complex problems? Well, the answer lies within the **node-to-node edge weights**. Each edge has its own, specially-tailored value that is meant to modify the outgoing signal to the next node, which is meant to modify that node's output, and so on. Therefore, each edge weight has a subtle, but important, impact on the final output of the model. \n\n**Crucially, with the right edge-weights, specifically tuned for a given problem, the model will be able to produce the desired outputs when given certain inputs**. And by using many more nodes and layers, and taking advantage of the cross-referencing nature of the model the system can correlate and leverage the many-to-many associations between inputs, nodes, and layers, and make inferences about the data on its own. This is why Deep Learning models using Neural networks don't necessarily need feature engineering like traditional ML methods.\n\n### Training A Neural Network via Backpropagation \nBut the caveat to the hyperbolic statement above is that *you need the correct edge-weights*. You can't simply construct a Neural Network with nodes, edges, and layers, and just guess yourself some edge weights and call it a day. These weights are not something that can simply be guessed through brute force; rather, they the component in the model that must get \"trained\". And they can only get trained by having lots of data (along with the answers to that data, i.e. a \"labeled\" data set) with which to train your model.\n\nTraining a Neural Network Goes something like this, again simplified for brevity:\n1. Get your raw data from somewhere (again, could be image data, medical data, etc).\n2. Initialize your edge weights to something random\n3. Transpose the data into the dimensions that fit your Neural Network Input Layer\n4. Feed it into the network and get the output\n5. Compare the output to what the answer SHOULD be\n6. Use \"Backpropagation\" and a \"Gradient Descent\" algorithm to adjust the edge weights so that, the next time you see the same inputs, the output will be nudged a little closer to the right answer.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img class=\"\" :src=\"'/nn_training.png'\" />\n    <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">A simplified Neural Network Training Diagram</span>\n</div>\n\nI'm handwaving backpropagation and gradient descent for now, since it involves [a lot of advanced math](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-backpropagation-algorithm-7bb3aa2f95fd) which I don't think is super relevant for beginners looking to simply get their feet wet in this field. So simply know that it's a powerful mathematical technique to efficiently adjust the edge-weights of your Neural Network to get closer to the right answer. Think of it has a sophisticated, advanced version of guess-and-check.\n\nIn short, a lot work has been put into backpropagation and gradient descent so that, when your network produces a result that's *wrong*, your network's edge weights get updated so that they'll be less wrong upon seeing the same inputs again. It's important to note that we don't want to drastically alter the edge weights' values: we don't want one single example to have a huge effect on the training (what if that single example is an outlier, like a weird looking cat?), but at the same time, we don't want the change to be so little as to not have any effect at all.\n\nAfter going the 6-step process above many, many times, your network will eventually start to converge on a set of \"good-enough\" edge weights that will work great for your training data set, and if done correctly, *should* work for data that it hasn't even seen before (which is the whole point of machine learning!).\n\n### Deciding How Many Nodes, Edges, and Layers to Use in a Network\nThe final question you may be wondering is: how do you determine the number of nodes or layers in a network? Unfortunately, there aren't many hard-and-fast rules, but rather, some accepted guidelines: \n- The more nodes, the more that your model can learn, but it will take longer for your model to learn and execute (and it's possible that your model may learn nothing at all if there's too many nodes)\n- For all but the most complex problems, 2 hidden layers may be enough.\n- Look for prior work similar to yours, and use similar network structures as a starting point\n- Simply experiment with different network parameters for your particular problem.\n\nI found the last bullet point the most useful, as I saw absolutely terrible performance for [my project](https://github.com/campbell000/DeepLearningProject) using 2 hidden layers with 256 nodes since, I dunno, that seemed reasonable. Performance was so bad that I was convinced that I had an implementation bug somewhere, and literally spent months re-writing everything. It wasn't until, on a whim, I increased my network to 4 hidden layers with 1000 nodes that I saw performance skyrocket. This could have been due to an inefficiency somewhere, but nevertheless, I still kick myself for not simply experimenting with network structure earlier on.\n\n## Summary\nHopefully, this has given you enough of an understanding for my next post, which will dive into using Keras, a library with powerful Deep Learning tools!","dir":"/articles","path":"/articles/beginners-guide-to-deep-learning","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2025-05-23T02:54:32.422Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1749094363651},"$loki":2},{"slug":"beginners-guide-to-deep-learning-keras","title":"A Beginner's Guide to Deep Learning (Part 2)","summary":"In this post, I'll show you how to write your first Deep Learning program using Tensorflow 2.0, which is a popular Deep Learning Library, and Keras, a popular high-level API to make Tensorflow a little more beginner-friendly.","shouldShowTableOfContents":true,"shouldShowUpdatedAt":false,"createdAt":"2020-11-17T23:41:34.140Z","tags":["How To","Programming"],"toc":[{"id":"disclaimer","depth":2,"text":"Disclaimer"},{"id":"prerequisites","depth":2,"text":"Prerequisites"},{"id":"setup","depth":2,"text":"Setup"},{"id":"install-python-3-and-pip","depth":3,"text":"Install Python 3 and pip"},{"id":"create-a-virtual-python-environment","depth":3,"text":"Create a virtual python environment"},{"id":"install-tensorflow-keras-and-all-dependencies","depth":3,"text":"Install Tensorflow, Keras, and All Dependencies"},{"id":"solving-our-first-problem-detecting-heart-disease","depth":2,"text":"Solving our First Problem: Detecting Heart Disease"},{"id":"getting-our-data","depth":3,"text":"Getting our data"},{"id":"building-the-neural-network","depth":3,"text":"Building the Neural Network"},{"id":"training-the-model","depth":3,"text":"Training the model"},{"id":"evaluating-the-model","depth":3,"text":"Evaluating the model"},{"id":"recap","depth":3,"text":"Recap"},{"id":"summary","depth":2,"text":"Summary"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"disclaimer"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#disclaimer","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Disclaimer"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"If you haven't aren't familiar with Deep Learning concepts already, make sure to check out "},{"type":"element","tag":"nuxt-link","props":{"to":"/beginners-guide-to-deep-learning"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Part One Here"}]},{"type":"text","value":", where I go over some essential concepts.

I also make some disclaimers about me not being an expert! So with that being said, let's get started!\n\n## Prerequisites\nI recommend being comfortable with the following concepts before continuing with this tutorial, although I'll try my best to spell everything out:\n- python\n- basic OS command line tools\n- basic statistics concepts (validation, probabilities, etc)\n\n## Setup\nI'm working in Ubuntu, so if you're working in Windows or Mac, and you want to follow these steps exactly, I recommend that you install an Ubuntu VM. Otherwise, if you want to stick with what you've got, you can use the next section as a loose guide as to what you'll need to get started.\n\n### Install Python 3 and pip\nFirst, we need to install Python 3. We also need to install \"pip\" which is a package manager for python (something that installs other python modules). To do so, run\n```bash\nsudo apt install python3 python3-pip\n```\n\n### Create a virtual python environment\nNext, we need to create a \"virtual python environment\". We do this so that we can install python dependencies on a per-project basis, and not disturb any system-wide python packages. In other words, when you install or remove python packages, it does so at a local level, so you can add/remove packages without worrying about messing anything up.\n\nTo do so, run the following commands:\n```bash\n# Installs the venv module\nsudo apt install python3-venv\n\n# Creates a virtual environment called \"dl-tutorial\" in your home directory \n# in the folder ~/.venv\nmkdir ~/.venv/dl-tutorial\npython3 -m venv ~/.venv/dl-tutorial\n```\n\nFinally, if all went well run, the following command: `source ~/.venv/dl-tutorial/bin/activate`. If you did everything right, you should see `(dl-tutorial)` pre-fixed in your terminal. If you didn't, repeat these steps again, or look up guides for creating python virtual.\n\n** Note that you will have to run `source ~/.venv/dl-tutorial/bin/activate` every time you start a new shell session!** This \"activates\" your virtual python environment.\n\n### Install Tensorflow, Keras, and All Dependencies\nNow that you have your python environment set up, run the following commands. I recommend running them one by one to ensure you don't get errors along the way.\n\n```bash\n# Ensures that your virtual environment is activated\nsource ~/.venv/dl-tutorial/bin/activate\n\n# Upgrades Setup Tools\npip install ––upgrade setuptools\n\n# Installs tensorflow\npip install tensorflow\n\n# Installs Keras\npip install keras\n```\n\n**Tensorflow** is a very-popular machine learning library developed and maintained by Google, and **Keras** is a wrapper around Tensorflow to make it a little friendlier to use. Unless your use-case is complex, or you are working on performance-critical code, you likely won't need to work with Tensorflow directly. That's why we'll be using Keras in this tutorial.\n\n## Solving our First Problem: Detecting Heart Disease\nSounds exciting, right? Well, to be clear, using neural networks for this particular example may not be the right tool for the job: traditional machine learning and statistical methods may be far simpler, and even more accurate, but for the sake of example, I think that this is an interesting use case. **Also, this is not to be used in any real medical capacity. This is just for educational purposes!**\n\n### Getting our data\n<a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci\">Start by downloading the dataset here</a> You will need to create an account, which kind of stinks, but I filled mine with totally fake information, so no need to worry about privacy.\n\nThe link above gives a pretty good description of the dataset, too: there are 14 columns in the dataset, and each row in the dataset contains information about a particular patient, such as their:\n- Age\n- Sex\n- Chest Pain Severity\n- Resting Heart Rate\n- Max Heart Rate Observed\n- Lots of Other Medical Metrics I don't understand :)\n- **Most importantly: a value of \"1\" if they have heart disease, and \"0\" if they don't.**\n\nI recommend opening up the file in Excel to understand how the data is represented.\n\n### Building the Neural Network\nAlright, let's get started. First, create a file and call it `dl_tutorial_01.py`. Also, grab the `heart.csv` file and place it right next to the python file you just created (for simplicity).\n\nVia Keras and Tensorflow, we'll be constructing a Feed-Forward Neural Network with a 13-node input layer, a 20-node hidden layer, ANOTHER 20-node hidden layer, and a single-node output layer.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img class=\"\" :src=\"'/nn-demo.png'\" />\n    <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">A diagram of what our neural network will look like</span>\n</div>\n\nWhy are we building our network like this? Well, recall what our dataset looks like: we have 14 columns in our dataset: 13 of the columns tell us about the patient, while 1 of the columns tells us about the we want to know whether the patient has heart disease our not. Therefore, we have 13 \"input variables\", and one \"output variable\". Hence, 13 nodes in the input layer, and one node in the output layer.\n\nIn the statistics world, this is sometimes called a **binary classification problem**, meaning that we are simply searching for a YES or a NO answer to a certain question. Numerically (remmeber, neural networks only function with numbers), this can be represented simply with 1 or 0. So we want our network to output either a 0 or a 1, indicating whether the patient has heart disease or not.\n\nLets start with the following code, which loads the essential Keras imports, as well as the dataset itself.\n\n```python [dl_tutorial_01.py]\nimport numpy\nfrom numpy import loadtxt\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\n\ndataset = loadtxt('heart.csv', delimiter=',', skiprows=1)\n```\n\nWe're loading the data into an array of arrays. To see what that looks like, let's print one row. Add the following line:\n```python [dl_tutorial_01.py]\nprint(\"Here is the first row of the heart.csv dataset:\")\nprint(dataset[0])\n```\n\nTo run what we have so far, run the following command: `python dl_tutorial_01.py`. You should see something like this (aside from an error about not being able to load a dynamic library, which you can ignore for now):\n\n```text\nHere is the first row of the heart.csv dataset:\n[ 63.  1.  3.  145.  233.  1.  0.  150.  0.  2.3   0.  0.  1.  1. ]\n```\n\nThis should match the first row in the dataset. Next, we want to separate the 13 input variables (age, sex, heart rate, etc), and single output variable (1/0 for \"do they have heart disease\"). We can do this using the code below:\n\n```python [dl_tutorial_01.py]\nx = dataset[:,0:13]\ny = dataset[:,13]\n```\n\nNow that we have our dataset, it's time to build our Neural Network as described above\n\n```python [dl_tutorial_01.py]\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(20, input_dim=13, activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(Dense(20, activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))\nmodel.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])\n```\nLet's break this down. The `model.add()` statements add layers to the model. The first statement specifies the input dimension, which is 13 nodes (corresponding to how many input variables in our dataset). They also specify something called an \"activation function\". \n\nSomething I've glossed over until now is that nodes don't simply take in values, sum them all up, and pass that sum along: it instead performs *some* kind of function on the sum before passing it along to the nodes in the next layer. The particular function being performed on it is the \"ReLU\" function, <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/rectified-linear-units-relu-in-deep-learning\">which is described here</a>. There are multiple functions to choose from, but for hidden layers, ReLU is the general, accepted choice.\n\nYou'll notice that, for the final layer, we have a one-node layer, with a *different* activation function: a sigmoid function. \n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img class=\"limitedMedium\" :src=\"'/sigmoid.png'\" />\n    <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">A Sigmoid function, identified by it's distinct \"S\" shape</span>\n</div>\n\nThis function constraints the output from 0 to 1, *which is exactly what we need for our binary classification task*. \n\nFinally, the `model.compile()` statement builds the model. Take note of the `loss='binary_crossentropy'` parameter: the loss function is used to evaluate how \"correct\", numerically, your neural network's prediction is when compared to the actual correct answer. You might think, \"just take the absolute difference between the two numbers\", but it's far more complicated than that. Loss functions aren't exclusive to Deep Learaning, and there are specialized functions for specific use cases. In our case, we use \"Binary Cross Entropy\", which, [as explained in this great post](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-binary-cross-entropy-log-loss-a-visual-explanation-a3ac6025181a), is best suited for binary classification problems.\n\nAlso note the `optimizer='adam'`. This specifies the gradient descent algorithm that we're using, something that I handwaved in Part 1. For the purposes of this post, you simply need to understand that the Adam algorithm is the most popular choice for Gradient Descent in Neural Networks, which is used to help the model now how to slowly adjust its edge-weights towards the \"correct\" set of edge-weights.\n\n### Training the model\nNow that we've built the model and specified *how* it should be trained, we can actually train the model by adding the code below:\n```python [dl_tutorial_01.py]\nmodel.fit(x, y, epochs=150, batch_size=10)\n```\nThis should take around 10 seconds or so, depending upon the speed of our CPU. This command is saying to go through the entire dataset 150 times, using batches of 10 samples to train the network.\n\nOnce it's done, congrats! We now have a (fake, toy) heart disease detector in python! Let's try it out on the first patient in the dataset, which we KNOW has \"1\" in the last column, indicating that they do. Add the following code and run it.\n\n```python [dl_tutorial_01.py]\nprediction = model.predict(x[0:1])\nprint(\"Prediction: \"+str(prediction[0][0]))\nprint(\"Ground Truth: \"+str(y[0]))\n```\n\nWhich will produce output something like this (your numbers may vary, due to the fact that that many factors in these algorithms are initialized to random numbers):\n\n```\nPrediction: 0.9282936\nGround Truth: 1.0\n```\n\nYou should see output concluding that our model is *pretty* confident that the first patient has heart disease. So what about for the entire dataset as a whole? It would be far too time consuming to manually check out model's output against the every value in the dataset, so we'll automate this process in the next section.\n\n### Evaluating the model\nTo evaluate our model, we'll use one commonly-used metric, \"accuracy\", which simply compares how many times our model guesses the correct answer relative to the total number of guesses. This is a one-liner in Keras, but for your own understanding, this logic is illustrated in the pseudo-code below\n```python\ncorrect = 0\nfor (sample in samples):\n  x = [sample][0]\n  y = [sample][1]\n\n  # if the model is 50% confident or more, consider it's output 1, otherwise consider its output 0\n  prediction = round(model.predict(x)) \n\n  # If the model's output matches the label, then consider its prediction correct\n  if (prediction == y)\n    correct += 1\n  \naccuracy = correct / len(samples)\n```\n\nHere's how easy Keras makes it:\n```python [dl_tutorial_01.py]\n_, accuracy = model.evaluate(x, y)\nprint('Accuracy: %.2f' % (accuracy*100))\n```\n\nYour should see an accuracy value somewhere around 80%. \n\n### Recap\nIf you've gotten this far, then you should have working code at this point! Here's the final copy of the code:\n```python [dl_tutorial_01.py]\n# Here, we're using Keras and Tensorflow to use feed-forward neural networks to predict heart disease, \n# using the heart_disease.csv dataset.\n\n# Import feedfoward keras stuff\nimport numpy\nfrom numpy import loadtxt\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\n\n# Load the dataset, and\ndataset = loadtxt('heart_disease.csv', delimiter=',', skiprows=1)\nx = dataset[:,0:13]\ny = dataset[:,13]\n\n# Build the Neural network. 2 Hidden layers.\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(20, input_dim=13, activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(Dense(20, activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))\nmodel.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])\nmodel.fit(x, y, verbose=0, epochs=150, batch_size=10)\n\n# Do a single prediction, just for fun\nprediction = model.predict(x[0:1])\nprint(\"Prediction: \"+str(prediction[0][0]))\nprint(\"Ground Truth: \"+str(y[0]))\n\n# Asses the accuracy of the model.\n_, accuracy = model.evaluate(x, y)\nprint('Accuracy: %.2f' % (accuracy*100))\n```\n\n## Summary\nAt this point, you've installed Tensorflow, Keras, built and trained a Neural Network on a binary classification task, and achieved around 80% accuracy. There are *many* more directions you could take your research from here. I've glossed over many things, such as:\n- The math behind backpropagation and gradient descent\n- Loss functions\n- How to evaluate the correctness of your Neural Network (accuracy is simply one metric)\n- Improving the accuracy of your model\n- Using other metrics (other than accuracy) to evaluate your model\n- Training Vs Testing your model (we \"evaluated\" our model on data it's already seen before, which is really not what you should be doing. We only did so for simplicity).\n\nHopefully I've given you enough to pique your interest in furthering your own research. As you can see, there's quite a bit of overlap between Deep Learning, machine learning, computer science, math, and statistics, so don't despair if it all seems a little overwhelming!\n\nStay tuned for another post, where I'll tackle another more-complicated task using Keras and machine learning!","dir":"/articles","path":"/articles/beginners-guide-to-deep-learning-keras","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2025-05-23T02:54:32.421Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1749094363682},"$loki":3},{"slug":"croppi-a-cropping-safari-extension","title":"Croppi: A Safari Extension for Easily Cropping Images","titleImage":"/crop.png","containImage":true,"summary":"An overview of the Safari Extension I created, which allows users to easily crop images and save them, without leaving Safari.","shouldShowTableOfContents":true,"shouldShowUpdatedAt":false,"shouldHideDonate":true,"createdAt":"2022-12-29T23:41:34.140Z","tags":["Programming","How To"],"toc":[{"id":"overview","depth":2,"text":"Overview"},{"id":"limitations","depth":2,"text":"Limitations"},{"id":"privacy","depth":2,"text":"Privacy"},{"id":"closing-remarks","depth":2,"text":"Closing Remarks"},{"id":"questions","depth":2,"text":"Questions?"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"overview"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#overview","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Overview"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Croppi is a simple iOS Safari extension that allows users to easily take screenshots, crop them, and save them to either the clipboard, or a file that can be saved.

I *hate* grinding, so I spent very little time with many of the game's outside-of-battle mechanics (but completed many of the Paralogues)\n* I've played about 5 *Fire Emblem* games. I'm no hardcore series veteran, but I know my way around the weapon triangle.\n\n## Context\n<info-box :source-name=\"'Every Game Reviewer in 2023'\" :source-link=\"'https://opencritic.com/game/13896/fire-emblem-engage'\">\nThe story and characters suck, but the gameplay is amazing. Three House's social elements were a waste of time, so less of that is also good. 8/10.\n</info-box>\n\nGiven that this is, pretty much, the universally-held opinion of *Fire Emblem: Engage*, why write a review almost a year after the game's release date? Hasn't everything that one could possible say about this game already been said?\n\nWhile not necessarily inaccurate (I'll get to that in a bit), I don't think it's entirely fair to *Engage*. In my opinion, the game deserves more than just \"It's a pretty good *Fire Emblem*\" game. Rather, there's a lot of things that the game gets right (and wrong) that warrant further discussion.\n\nI've been a fan of the series since *Fire Emblem: Awakening* (I can hear \"LynLover86\" yelling in the background), but I've played many *Fire Emblem* titles since then: *Conquest* (3DS), *Echoes: Shadows of Valentia* (3DS), and *Sacred Stones* (GBA). But starting with *Awakening*, I immediately fell in love with the series' unforgiving, calculated gameplay. There's nothing else quite like it.\n\nI passed on *Three Houses* (*Engage's* predecessor) due to how heavily it appeared to lean on its <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'Seeing my wife spend her precious time organizing tea parties with the game\\'s NPCs didn\\'t exactly pique my interest...'\">social sim elements</text-with-tooltip>, and since *Engage's* reviews seemed to imply that these elements had been significantly pared back, I figured that *Engage* would be a great time for me to jump back into the series.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer imageUnderSection\">\n  <img :src=\"'/veyle.webp'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">There's no need to be afraid. The social dating-sim elements from Fire Emblem: Three Houses are gone. <a src=\"https://www.nookgaming.com/fire-emblem-engage-review/\">Image Credit: Nook Gaming</a></span>\n</div>\n\nSo, after managing to bring all of my units safely to the finish line (despite being tempted to offer Bunet as my sacrificial <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'Get it? He\\'s the character that likes to cook! Funny, right?'\">lambchop</text-with-tooltip>), what did I think of *Engage*?\n\n## The Good\n### Presentation\nEverybody knows by now that I hate silly anime designs as much as the next guy. When screenshots of this game first came out, fans of the series starting disaffectionately referring to the main character as \"[Toothpaste-chan](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/alear-toothpaste-chan)\", and I can't say that I disagree; his/her design *is* ridiculous (doubly so for the female version's accentuating-tie-between-the-boobs look).\n\nBut despite this, I'll admit that I *really* like *Engage's* vibrant art style. It lends a brightness and energy to the experience that (in my opinion) gives the game a more modern-looking feel.\n\nThis carries over to the game's character design; yes, the game still borrows heavily from the high-fantasy genre, evident by the amount of tomes, lances, and capes present. But when units are paired with special units called \"Emblems\", these designs veer into uncharted, neon-glowing territories. Some characters sprout futuristic wings, while others are adorned with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/future.jpeg\">spinning propulsion systems</a>. As to *how* these futuristic aesthetics make sense in the *Fire Emblem* universe, I'm not really sure. But if I'm being honest, I'd call it a welcome change-up from a style that the series has gotten, perhaps, too comfortable with.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer imageUnderSection\">\n  <img :src=\"'/fecolor.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">Say what you want about the character designs, but there's no denying that <i>Engage's</i> art style can be striking at times. <a src=\"https://serenesforest.net/2022/11/29/fire-emblem-engage-emblem-celica-analysis/\">Image Credit: Serenes Forest</a></span>\n</div>\n\nMore importantly, *Engage* greatly improves upon <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'Three Houses\\' muddy visual design actively hindered my wife\\'s ability to get an accurate read on the battlefield.'\">its predecessor</text-with-tooltip> in regards to visual clarity. While not perfect (more on that later), the game's bright colors make units stand out a bit better against the background. And for a game that primarily tasks players with answering questions likes \"where are my positional weak points?\", or \"where should I begin my assault?\", or \"who is going to die next turn unless I intervene?\", this stylistic change-up is much appreciated.\n\nAnd, as expected from any mainline Nintendo game, *Engage's* music is simply phenomenal (excluding its <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'Attention anime/videogame composers: instrumental melodies are NOT interchangeable with lyrical melodies! A melody that sounds great when played on a guitar will NOT NECESSARILY sound great when sung!'\">terrible opening theme</text-with-tooltip>). I'm not sure how else to the describe it, but it's absolutely criminal that this game's soundtrack didn't win every video game music award, ever.\n\nThe game's excellent soundtrack is complemented by an excellent sense of audio awareness: *Engage* knows when to deploy something soft and sweet, and it also knows when to ramp up the tempo. Most importantly (and I can't stress this enough), it knows when to get out of the way; most of *Engage's* mid-battle music is catchy, but not obtrusive or attention-grabbing, giving players plenty of mental space to think. Far too often do games (anime games in particular) get carried away with complicated melodies during moments that deserve attention elsewhere, and thankfully, *Engage* is acutely aware of this.\n\n<youtube-link :src-link=\"'https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j3UmYT3fSic?si=nlIE8Kv2wvKbqcLs'\">This song's use of <i>Fire Emblem's</i> main theme is simply to <i>die</i> for. And that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin\">theremin!</a> Such an unexpected, yet interesting, choice of instrumentation.</youtube-link>\n\nSpeaking of audio, I also have to mention that (aside from a few stinkers like the main male protagonist) there are some *steller* voice acting performances in this game. [Censorship controversy aside](https://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/10ejmqf/fe_engage_censorship_discusiion/), characters like Goldmary, Ivy, and Yunaka give standout performances.\n\nPut simply, this is *by far* the best looking and best sounding *Fire Emblem* game to date. \n\n### Gameplay\nYes, I said that I was going to touch on aspects that *weren't* talked about to death, but it bears repeating that the moment-to-moment gameplay during battles is peak *Fire Emblem*. I'm going to avoid explaining the ins-and-outs of the mechanics (you can find that [here](https://www.ign.com/wikis/fire-emblem-engage/Beginner's_Guide)) so that I can focus on commentary, rather than explanations. But if you decide to stop reading here, let me reiterate: if you like *Fire Emblem* games, then *Engage* is a must-play.\n\nFor those still with me, let me expand on that: in my opinion, *Fire Emblem* is at its best when it feels like you're playing *chess*, rather than a typical RPG. Sure, stats, EXP, and character progression can be compelling features that encourage player freedom and choice, but they can also disrupt a game's balance. Being overleveled tends to trivialize the strategy experience, while being *under*leveled tends to force players to waste time grinding or playing silly minigames.\n\nPut another way, I'd rather win a battle of *wits*, rather than a battle of *patience*.\n\nIn this sense, I'm happy to report that, despite it containing a plethora of ways to waste players' time, *Engage* is still more than willing to get out of its own way. None of the game's silly systems (tea parties, ring polishing, \"Take care of a virtual cat-looking thing\", etc) are required to succeed in *Engage*.\n\nWant proof? Despite me being of average intelligence and having less-than-average patience, I was able to complete the game on Hard/<text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'In \\'Classic\\' mode, when units die, they are dead for good. This USED to be the norm for Fire Emblem games, but recent installments have made this feature opt-in.'\">Classic</text-with-tooltip> mode without interacting with *any* of these features. Instead, *Engage* helpfully gives players everything they need to succeed as long as they pay careful attention to the way they <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'Some people online have complained that Engage doesn\\'t give you enough crafting materials or gold, but I think they\\'re missing the point: the game is fun precisely BECAUSE you have to make hard decisions about where to spend your resources.'\">allocate resources</text-with-tooltip>.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/fegameplay.jpg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">Thinking several moves ahead (again, like Chess) will prove vital in ensuring that all of a player's units survive. <a src=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/fire-emblem-engage-is-a-proud-celebration-of-all-that-came-before-it\">Image Credit: Eurogamer</a></span>\n</div>\n\nThat I was able to complete the game in the way I wanted to is a testament to how brilliant some of its mechanics are. One such mechanic is the re-introduction of the series' classic <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'Swords beat axes, axes beat lances, and lances beat swords. Oh, and mages\\' weakness is PUNCHING. So, I guess it\\'s not really a triangle.'\">\"weapon triangle\"</text-with-tooltip>. Like other *Fire Emblem* games, the weapon triangle gives each unit a clear role to nestle into. \n\nFor some examples: up against a lot of armored foes? Then it'd be wise to deploy lots of magic users. Surrounded by flying units? Bring a couple of archers to snipe them down. The map is crawling with mages? Deploy your speedy swordsmen to pierce through their delicate robes.\n\n*Engage* also adds an excellent twist to the formula: by attacking a unit with what they're weak against (i.e. hitting an axe wielder with a sword), the opponent becomes \"broken\", meaning that they cannot counter attack for the next few turns. Again, it's another tool that players can use to add extra utility to low-damage units, or added life insurance for low-defense units.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer imageUnderSection\">\n  <img :src=\"'/break.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">Hopefully Engage's Break mechanic becomes a permanent addition to the series. <a src=\"https://nintendoeverything.com/fire-emblem-engage-details-break-in-battle/\">Image Credit: Nintendo Everything</a></span>\n</div>\n\nThe sum of these changes means that players are forced to carefully consider the selection of each unit and their weapons before embarking, rather than mindlessly picking their most powerful units. Battles become less about how much resources or XP the player has, and more about intelligent use of the tools available to them, which is *exactly* what I want in a strategy game.\n\nThis ties into other reason that *Engage's* gameplay excels: there are *so many* tools at the player's disposal that they can leverage, and this is thanks to the game's ingenious <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'When paired with Fire Emblem characters from past games, represented as rings, your units can temporarily boost their stats and abilities, which can be enough to bring back a battle from the brink of defeat.'\">\"Emblem system\"</text-with-tooltip>.\n\nWant to temporarily give your unit the ability to teleport someone across the map? Want to dash *through* lines of enemies? What about an ability that lures enemies in for one turn, culminating in a huge multi-space explosion on the next? The Emblem system makes this, and more, possible.\n\nAny Emblem can be paired with any unit, which opens up a floodgate of possibilities, which encourages player experimentation and creativity. For example, one of my favorite moments with *Engage* was when I concocted a hare-brained strategy that hinged upon using <span class=\"spoiler\">Veyle</span> and Micaiah to launch Timerra and Ike half-way across the map, and the payoff when it actually *worked* was incredible. \n\nEven *more* interesting is that enemies can use these emblems and their abilities, too. I'll admit that the Emblems seemed a little *too* overpowered in *Engage's* first half, but proved to be absolutely essential in the second half in order to contend with enemies using these same tools against you.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer imageUnderSection\">\n  <img :src=\"'/evilmarth.webp'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">Enemies can use Emblems, too. For example, Lyn's \"Astra Storm\", which fires a barrage of arrows from a million miles away, can be particularly disruptive to an otherwise ironclad strategy. <a src=\"https://serenesforest.net/2022/11/29/fire-emblem-engage-emblem-celica-analysis/\">Image Credit: Tech Raptor</a></span>\n</div>\n\nAnd if the complexity of this sounds scary to you, then fear not: almost every Emblem comes with a default pairing that is more than adequately strong. For example, Marth is naturally paired with Alear, Timerra is naturally paired with Ike, etc. So, if you'd rather have this process streamlined, *Engage* is willing to help.\n\nI also want to briefly discuss the game's <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'For each battle, the game gives you 10 opportunities to revert the game\\'s state back to an earlier point in time.'\">\"rewind system\"</text-with-tooltip>: some people online seem to absolutely *detest* its inclusion in modern *Fire Emblem* games, but I think most of their arguments boil down to \"you're not a real gamer\". Fortunately for me, my time is far more valuable than the opinions of people on the internet that I've never met, and I'd imagine that most well-adjusted players will feel the same. I *suppose* you could make an argument that the absence of a safety net could make battles more tense, but no one is forcing a gun to anyone's head to use it. Overall, I welcomed the feature.\n\nIn summary:  above all else, *Engage* excels as a strategy game. Past the anime cringe, threadbare story, and pointless time-wasters (more on that below), the game is a masterclass in addictive, thoughtful, and flexible strategy game design. For that reason alone, I'd recommend it both to newcomers to the genre *and* fans of the series.\n\n## The Meh\nUnfortunately, despite my praise, *Engage* has plenty of issues. I wouldn't call any of them a \"deal breaker\", so instead of spending paragraphs on each issue, I'll briefly touch on each one:\n\n* I cannot overstate how robotic and stilted the main (male) character's performance is. Almost every time Alear spoke, I couldn't help but think, \"this is a terrible approximation of how humans talk\". I'm not a voice actor, but I *think* this is due to how cleanly-enunciated his lines are. The actor seems far too concerned with making every syllable crystal clear, which gives his performance an alien-like quality.\n\n* Support conversations with Emblems consist of two characters blurting out meaningless rhetoric at each other (\"When facing adversity, hold strong and believe in our friendship to turn the tide of battle\"). It would have been nice to converse with past *Fire Emblem* characters, rather than with motivational posters.\n\n* There are a few interesting maps in the mix (Alear's Paralouge is a highlight), but most missions simply task players to defeat all of the opponents' units.\n\n* As mentioned above, don't both with any of the activities at <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'The game\\s hubworld. Players return to it after every battle.'\">the Somniel</text-with-tooltip>. They're anti-fun time sinks that don't offer any meaningful rewards. For example, I completely ignored the little cat thing since every interaction triggered an unskippable 15-second cutscene.\n\n* While most of the game's character designs are simply silly (I actually *like* [Timerra's design!](https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/Timerra)), some designs border on ridiculous. Why is [Ivy](https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/Ivy) wearing a *cage* on her face? Was [Celine](https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/C%C3%A9line) modeled after a cupcake? Why does [Panette](https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/Panette) look like [Jack Skellington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Skellington)?\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/goldmar.jpg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">And for my final question: how on earth was Goldmary able to vacuum-seal her boobs to her dress?</span>\n</div>\n\n## The Ugly\nWe now arrive at the section where I talk about issues that actively hindered my experience with *Engage*. More than a little frustrating, these are problems that absolutely need to be addressed in future installments of the *Fire Emblem* series.\n\n### Information Management and Discovery\nOne major issue with *Engage* that doesn't seem to be present in online discourse is how *poor* the game's information management is. For a game where players need to know as much about the current battle as possible, I'm honestly shocked by how much *Engage* regresses in this area.\n\nFor comparison's sake, let's start by taking a look at *Fire Emblem: Awakening*, a game released in 2012 on the 3DS.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer imageUnderSection\">\n  <img :src=\"'/awakening.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">Despite the low resolution, notice how absolutely jam-packed <i>Awakening's</i> interface is with useful info right at the player's fingertips. <a src=\"https://discoveringgamedesign.wordpress.com/2015/02/13/closer-look-fire-emblem-awakenings-interface/\">Image Credit: Discovering Game Design</a></span>\n</div>\n\n[This awesome blog post](https://discoveringgamedesign.wordpress.com/2015/02/13/closer-look-fire-emblem-awakenings-interface/), which deserves its own read, goes into great detail about how *Awakening* made full and excellent use of the 3DS's dual screens. Enemy and player units are clear and distinct, unit stats/weapons/skills are organized and accessible, and with the tap of the screen, the entire map can be displayed to get a general sense of player/enemy positioning. As an added UX flourish, *anything* can be tapped on to reveal more information. Want to be reminded about what Dexterity does, or the effect of a certain skill? Simply tap on it to reveal a tooltip explaining exactly that. For most humans <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'If you\\'re able to remember all 6 modifiable skills for every unit ON TOP OF the skills that Emblems grant, then congrats, you\\'re smarter than me.'\">with average INT stats</text-with-tooltip>, such a feature is invaluable.\n\nPut simply, not once while playing *Awakening* did I find it difficult to quickly get the information I needed to confidently make decisions.\n\nNow, let's look at *Engage*. Let's say that I want to remind myself what abilities a particular unit has. Here's how I'd do that:\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer imageUnderSection\">\n  <img :src=\"'/scroll.webp'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\"></span>\n</div>\n\nTo figure out what the right-most ability does, I need to select the unit, press X, and them use the d-pad to move the cursor *all the way* to the right. For those counting at home, that is **14** button presses. \n\nTo answer clever readers that might be thinking, \"well, obviously you're playing in *Docked* mode! Surely you can tap on the interface while undocked!\", then I'd agree with you: that would be an *perfectly sufficient* compromise. But no, *Fire Emblem: Engage* for the Nintendo Switch, featuring an OLED 6-inch touchscreen, does *not* utilize the touch screen.\n\nConfusingly, the interface also omits certain stats, such as Dexterity, Dodge, and Luck, the first two being *really* important in the latter half of the game. To view these stats, one has to press the \"-\" button (which is seldom used in most Switch games), which triggers a 2 second transition to a *different* screen that *replaces* the overhead view. Take a look:\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer imageUnderSection\">\n  <img :src=\"'/stats.jpg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">If you need to be reminded as to what \"Luck\" does, you'll have to press \"Down\" about 20 times.</span>\n</div>\n\nGreat, I can view the unit's stats, but now I can't see the battlefield anymore. What was I doing again? What kinds of enemies is this unit near? Context-switches like these are especially disruptive for a game that is mostly cerebral.\n\nLet's play a different game: in the screenshot below, which unit still hasn't acted yet?\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer imageUnderSection\">\n  <img :src=\"'/feint.jpg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">There is not nearly enough of a distinction between units, which is exacerbated when moved units become gray-tinted.</span>\n</div>\n\nThe answer is: the unit left of the selected unit (Timerra). But how long did it take you to find him? If you're like me, then the answer is \"way too long\".\n\nThis highlights another issue: why do character models (especially when grayed-out) look so *similar* to each other? As I mentioned earlier, *Engage* is, thankfully, much more visually clear than *Three houses*, but both pale in comparison to *Awakening's* incredibly distinct 2D sprites.\n\nTo be clear, this is a functional complaint, rather than an aesthetic complaint: during my time with *Engage*, I would often misidentify my flying units, thinking I was moving one with high resistance when I was actually moving a unit with *low* resistance (i.e. Hortensia vs Rosado). This would often lead to cheap, frustrating, and ultimately avoidable deaths.\n\nThere are many more criticisms I could levy about this game's interface. For example, the game's minimap display, which used to occupy the bottom screen in *Awakening*, now has three options: hidden, uselessly ant-sized, or gigantically-obtrusive. Couldn't they have picked some middle ground, or allowed players to fiddle with its opacity? And why does the minimap not differentiate between moved and unmoved units? Coupled with a camera that is either way too zoomed in or way too zoomed out, the *Engage's* minimap is practically useless.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer imageUnderSection\">\n  <img :src=\"'/stats2.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">Why does Alear have a +2 speed modifier? It will cost you 11 button presses to figure out that valuable piece of information.</span>\n</div>\n\nIn case it's not clear, for a game that requires players to have a keen sense on where units are, which abilities and weapons they're equipped with, and what their weaknesses are, these UI/UX issues are *unacceptable*. Sure, previous games in the series had two screens to work with, but surely they could have thought of *something* better than what was implemented. \n\nIn summary, for a game on a console with *far* more pixels than a 3DS, DS, or even a GBA, this game has far too many issues with its UI, and I hope that these issues will be addressed in future installments.  \n\n### The Story\nMy final major gripe with this game is its narrative. Or more specifically, its lack of one.\n\nLet me start with an example. Very minor spoilers below:\n\nPicture all of your units, along with their Emblems, <span class=\"spoiler\">pledging their lives to fight one final battle. Some have been undyingly loyal from day one, while others have acquiesced to fate, recognizing that differences must be set aside in order to save the world. The fate of the world rests upon this moment, and none of your units are taking it lightly.</span>\n\n<span class=\"spoiler\">As your gaggle of anime dweebs stand steadfast, the music swells in intensity while the main villain snarls one final vicious insult, taunting you with malicious indifference. </span> Suddenly, as the battle starts, the game's main theme song cuts through the melodrama like a sharpened <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'A classic sword in Fire Emblem. It has very high Critical Hit rates.'\">Killing Edge</text-with-tooltip>, kicking the action into high gear.\n\n<youtube-link :src-link=\"'https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MNJqgyNgCYA?si=k9Rnx5R07acBrGW0&amp;start=59'\">Without lyrics, the game's main theme is actually really cool.</youtube-link>\n\nI ain't gonna lie: this was an awesome moment. It genuinely felt intense, exciting, and (I can't believe I'm saying this) inspiring as I pondered, for the final time, how best to prepare for what seemed like impossible odds. It was the highest point in my entire playthrough, and stands as a shining example of what games in this genre should aspire to achieve.\n\nSo, how does this square with my complaint about *Engage's* narrative? Well, it's because this moment occurs *right before the end of the game*. It's the one and only time that *Engage* had elicited those feelings from me.\n\nIn other words, it takes roughly 40-60 hours for *Engage* to give the player any sense of purpose, or for the narrative to gain any kind of tension or drama. This is *far* too long.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer imageUnderSection\">\n  <img :src=\"'/cutscene.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">The pre-rendered cutscenes are nice, but are very few and far between. <a src=\"https://www.thumbculture.co.uk/fire-emblem-engage-switch-review\">Image Credit: Thumb Culture</a></span>\n</div>\n\nI think the main problem with *Engage's* story is that it follows an awfully-predictable formula based on collecting things: as soon as I landed in Firene and saw that there were 4 more countries on the map, I knew exactly how the story would play out: visiting each kingdom to find their pact rings, encountering *some* kind of snag in the process, but ultimately leaving with new rings (and new party members) in tow. And sure enough, that's exactly how it went.\n\nAs I processed this, I came to a dreadful realization.\n\n\"Oh no\", I thought. \"It's one of *those* games\"\n\nI absolutely *hate it* when a games's narrative is based around recruitment and collection because it telegraphs to the player the *exact* path that the story will take them through. The story becomes less of an organic human experience, and more like a grocery list to make tomorrow night's dinner. Firene? Check. Brodia? Check. Solm? Check. Elusia? Check.\n\nAnd I don't think I need to explain how a painfully predictable story can sap any and all intrigue out of the experience. Inevitably, this means that *Engage's* story has absolutely no momentum until the last handful of chapters in the game. To say that *Engage's* pacing is terrible understates how much of a slog 80% of the game's story is.\n\nBut what about the characters that join the crew along the way? Surely they add some interesting dynamics to an otherwise dull story?\n\nHardly. As new units join the player's army, they're given about 5 minutes of screen time until they're whisked away to permanently live in the game's menus, never to be heard from again. Sure, they're happy to chatter away during support conversations, but aside from a <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'For some reason, the game reserves intrigue and nuance exclusively for it villain-esque characters, such as Zephia, Ivy, and Hortensia. As a result, they (along with oddball Yunaka) are far more interesting than the rest of the cast.'\">few exceptions</text-with-tooltip>, these optional cutscenes do little more than establishing that \"this one likes to exercise\", or \"this one wants to be cute\".\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer imageUnderSection\">\n  <img :src=\"'/supports.webp'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">Gee, I wonder what the chef-looking character that loves to cook will talk to me about?</span>\n</div>\n\nI can somewhat sympathize with *Engage's* writers: how do you weave new characters into a game's plot when almost each and every one of them <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'The Fire Emblem series is somewhat famous for its permadeath design: when characters are defeated on the battlefield, they\\'re typically gone for good.'\">can be killed</text-with-tooltip>? How do you give depth to a character when the game's design basically prevents it?\n\nIf the series wants to cling to its perma-death design, then I don't think that this is a problem that can be solved. The only solution that I can think of is for future games to decrease the number of recruitable units so that more time can be spent with each one.\n\nBut regardless of why, the end result is that *Engage's* narrative loses steam *very* quickly because its character roster is ocean-wide and puddle-deep. And I've said this before: without compelling characters, there is no *story*. There's just things that happen.\n\nTo its credit, *Engage* does hint at something deeper with its characters: <span class=\"spoiler\">What exactly was Sombon's deal, and who was the Foundational Emblem? Why is Zephia so desperate for a family, and what led to the formation of the Four Hounds? What were Alear and Veyle like before the war 1000 years ago?</span>.\n\nBut unfortunately, none of these questions are <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'It\\'s possible that the DLC delves into this, but a $60 game shouldn\\'t require additional purchases in order to make a narrative whole.'\">ever answered</text-with-tooltip>, and we're left with *implications* of a larger, more expansive narrative without it ever being delivered. Instead, *Engage* is content with telling (rather than showing) us about all these supposedly important events that happened 1000's of years ago, foolishly believing that a bit of exposition is enough to get players invested in it's story. Obviously, it's not.\n\nNevertheless, this is precisely *why* I wanted to begin this section with that single example of a time where *Engage's* narrative was thrilling and tense; it suggests that it's possible for a *Fire Emblem* game to be both mechanically *and* narratively interesting.\n\nBut unfortunately, this example also highlights how disappointing the rest of the game's story is. *Engage's* narrative could have been great, but it's perhaps one of the blandest, uninteresting stories in the entire series (and I've played *Fates*, which is routinely mocked for its terrible story).\n\n## Conclusion\n<div class=\"imageContainer imageUnderSection\">\n  <img :src=\"'/engage.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">The main character, Alear, pondering a world where Fire Emblem games can be fun AND have great stories. <a src=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2023/01/05/consider-me-engaged\">Image Credit: Game Informer</a></span>\n</div>\n\nWith all of that said (goddamnit, why am I so bad at keeping these reviews succinct?), I can confidently state that absolutely nobody plays *Fire Emblem* games for their stories. Indeed, not a single person on this planet has ever uttered the words, \"I'm incredibly excited for the next Fire Emblem game's story!\" Rather, their stories are often complimentary to what is already a deep and addicting experience. I'd much prefer the way that *Engage* turned out over the inverse (i.e. a story-heavy game with weaker gameplay).\n\nIn conclusion, I suppose this review *can* be summed up as:\n\n<info-box :source-name=\"'Nevermeant.dev'\" :source-link=\"'https://opencritic.com/game/13896/fire-emblem-engage'\">\nThe story and characters suck, but the gameplay is amazing. Three House's social elements were a waste of time, so less of that is also good. 8/10.\n</info-box>\n\nIn all seriousness, I hope this review was helpful for those that haven't played *Engage*, or provided some interesting points to consider for those that have.\n\n(One final note: not a single *Engage* pun can be found in this review. I'm incredibly proud of myself for that.)\n\n**Verdict: 4 Critical Hits out of 5**","dir":"/articles","path":"/articles/fire-emblem-engage-date-story-marry-gameplay","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2025-05-23T02:54:32.423Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1749094363750},"$loki":5},{"slug":"halo-tracker","title":"Wednesday Night Halo Crew Stats","shouldShowTableOfContents":true,"shouldShowUpdatedAt":true,"shouldHideDonate":true,"summary":"A FUN and LIGHT-HEARTED stat tracker for the Halo Night Boodies","titleImage":"/halotracker.jpg","createdAt":"2025-03-30T00:00:00.140Z","tags":["Gaming"],"toc":[{"id":"the-stats","depth":2,"text":"The Stats"},{"id":"faqs","depth":2,"text":"FAQs"},{"id":"such-slander-where-did-you-get-this-data","depth":3,"text":"Such slander!

Their write-ups rely on fear and ignorance of the audience to shill expensive and unnecessary upgrades. Ever notice that all of their articles are chock full of amazon referral links ($$$)?\n\nSo, fear not: I'm not here to sell you anything. Instead, I will be giving you the tools you need to make informed decisions, and then give you short, concise recommendations based on specific use cases.\n\nSecondly, I want to shout out <a href=\"https://www.rtings.com/\">RTINGS.com</a>. I've sourced some of their images in this article, and in general, I've used their product reviews to help me make informed decisions when buying my own gear. They are independently funded, so if you have the means, throw some support their way.\n\n## Essential concepts\nBefore making any decision about what to purchase, it's important to understand the basic concepts of display technology so that you can make meaningful comparisons between displays on your own. The main concepts are covered in the subsections below:\n\n### Resolution\nResolution refers to how many pixels are on the screen, often abbreviated to specific measurements like \"1080p\" or \"4k\", and sometimes \"FHD\" and \"QHD\". Increasing the number of pixels on the screen allows you to discern more detail in any given image. See the chart below illustrating the difference in pixel count between the various resolution categories:\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img class=\"\" :src=\"'/resolution.png'\" />\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">Comparison between 720p, 1080p, and 4K, taken from <a href=\"https://www.rtings.com/tv/learn/4k-ultra-hd-uhd-vs-1080p-full-hd-tvs-and-upscaling-compared\">RTings</a></span>\n</div>\n\n### Refresh Rate (or \"framerate\")\nThe refresh rate of a display is the maximum amount of frames-per-second that the display supports, often expressed as \"60hz\", \"120hz\", etc. This affects the blurriness of objects in motion. When you have high refresh rates, objects will appear very clear and distinct while in motion. When refresh rates are low, objects will appear blurry and indistinct while in motion. \n\nTo put it another way, think of frame rate like the number of pages in a flipbook: when there are more pages in a flip book for a given animation, the animation will be smoother. When there are *less* pages, then the animation will be choppier. \n\n<div class=\"imageContainer small\">\n  <img class=\"small\" :src=\"'/flip_book.gif'\" />\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption\">This is a flipbook, <a href=\"https://nycdoe-cs4all.github.io/units/4/learning_activities/la_1\">taken from here</a></span>\n</div>\n\nThe refresh rate of a display functions on the same principal: animations will be smoother when the refresh rate of a monitor is higher, and vice versa.\n\nNote that buying a high refresh-rate display will have little benefit if your games have low framerates. For example, if you only play Nintendo Switch or PS4 games, it makes little sense to buy a 120hz monitor, since both consoles can only output at 60hz.\n\n### Response Time\nThis marketing point is probably the most-talked-about, yet also the least understood. It does **not** measure how fast the monitor \"responds\" to your mouse/controller inputs. Instead, it measures how fast a pixel changes colors. In practice, this affects how blurry an object appears as it moves across your screen, which is important for action-oriented games. See the image below, which is taken from <a href=\"https://www.rtings.com/tv/tests/motion/motion-blur-and-response-time\">RTings's excellent article on response time:</a>\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img class=\"\" :src=\"'/response_time.PNG'\" />\n</div>\n\nThe object in motion is blurrier on the left because of the monitor's worse response time (33.3ms) than the monitor on the right (6.8ms). This metric is usually pretty easy to find in the advertising for a TV or monitor.\n\n### Input Latency (or \"Input Lag\")\nThis is the time is takes for the display to respond to your mouse/controller/keyboard\\*. This is most important in action-oriented games, but in my opinion, a display with bad input latency feels terrible in almost every use case: working, gaming, chatting, etc.\n\nsee below for an example of very high input latency:\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img class=\"limitedMedium\" :src=\"'/inputLag.gif'\" />\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">Note the delay between when the stick is tilted, and when the character actually moves. That's input lag. <a href=\"https://www.resetera.com/threads/resolutions-frame-rates-polygon-count-and-load-times-are-all-cool-but-can-we-please-address-input-delay.120575/page-3\">Taken from Here</a></span>\n</div>\n\nUnfortunately, information about any given display's input latency is difficult to find. Most display manufacturers neglect to include this metric in their marketing, and without expensive tools, it's difficult for an average consumer to measure this for themselves. \n\nTo make matters more confusing, input latency has very weak correlations to price: sometimes, very expensive displays will have high latency, while very cheap ones may have low latency. Therefore, you'll have to rely on independent sources for this information. Fortunately, <a href=\"https://www.rtings.com/monitor/tests/inputs/input-lag\">RTings publishes their input lag test results</a>, so you can check their database before you buy anything.\n\n### HDMI Versions\nOne final thing you'll need to understand is HDMI support. In order to achieve 4K/120hz, your TV or monitor will need to support HDMI 2.1. See the chart below on how the HDMI versions correlate to resolution and framerate:\n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\n.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-u0o7{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;text-decoration:underline;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n</style>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th class=\"tg-u0o7\">HDMI Version</th>\n    <th class=\"tg-u0o7\">Max Resolution</th>\n    <th class=\"tg-u0o7\">Max Framerate @ 4K</th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">1.4</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">4K</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">30</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">2</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">4k</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">60</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">2.1</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">10k</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">120</td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br/>\nThe implication of this chart is that, if your TV or monitor is 4K, but only supports HDMI 1.4, then that means that you WONT be able to achieve 4K/60FPS. So double check the highest supported HDMI version before buying something, especially if you plan on purchasing the display for a console.\n\n## TV or Monitor?\nA major decision you'll need to make is whether you want a TV or monitor. Historically, TVs are usually cheaper since they're more of a commodity, but at the high-end (i.e. 4K 120hz) TV's tend to be *more* expensive than monitors. Regardless, I think the most important factor is your use case:\n- Do you need something big to sit in a living room? Or will it go on a table/desk? \n- Do you strictly play console games? Or do you play PC games?\n- Do you own a laptop? Or do you own a desktop PC and find use in a standalone monitor?\n\nThe one major advantage of a monitor, however, is that they usually have much better input latency than TVs. Your average monitor will have latency somewhere between 8ms and 30ms, while your average consumer TV (i.e. from Best Buy and the like) may have input latency anywhere between 30ms and 100ms.\n\n### I Need a Monitor\nIf you need a monitor, then you'll need to take note of the HDMI specification chart above, and you'll also need to decide on the type of \"display technology\" you want. Briefly, they're described below:\n- **IPS**: has the best viewing angles and colors. Slower response times than TN panels, and usually more expensive\n- **TN**: Fastest response times but colors change the most when viewed at an angle. Usually the cheapest\n- **VA**: Somewhere in between IPS and TN. In my opinion, I wouldn't recommend these for anyone.\n\nNote that if you have a somewhat high budget, you can \"brute-force\" your way to an IPS display that has fast response times and good input latency, so I'd recommend an IPS panel if your budget allows for it. The best way to decide between these three is to simply go to a computer store and check out examples.\n\n## What Do I Do With This Information?\nWith all of this information, you have a choice to make based on what matters to you (unless you have unlimited money, in which case you can buy LG or Sony's most expensive OLED TV and stop reading). You'll likely need to mix and match the following features based on your needs:\n- Higher Resolutions\n- Higher Refresh Rates\n- Better Response Times\n- Low Input Latency\n- Supported HDMI Versions\n- Extra Features (i.e. additional inputs like DisplayPort, Roku, Spyware Virtual Assistants).\n\nYou won't be able to maximize all of these features without spending a ton of cash, so read on for some general recommendations.\n\n## My Recommendations\nArmed with the knowledge that I've imparted to you, below you'll find my recommendations on what kind of display to purchase based on common use cases:\n\n**If you know for a fact that you'll be consuming 4K/120FPS content:** purchase a 4K/120FPS monitor or TV with HDMI 2.1. Prices will be around $1000+, regardless of whether you choose a TV or monitor. This is not recommended unless you own a powerful PC, as console games aren't even close to *truly* reaching these rendering specs (despite the marketing push for \"4K\").\n\n**If you consider yourself a casual gamer who games on either PC or Console**: purchase a 4K/60FPS monitor or TV that supports HDMI 2.0. This should be MOST TVs made within the past 3-4 years, so you may not need to purchase one at all if you already own a 4K TV. Prices for 4K monitors should be fairly reasonable, too.\n\n**If you consider yourself a serious gamer, and own a Series X, PS5, or PC:** buy a 1440p monitor with a high refresh rate, such as 120hz or 144hz. This is the sweetspot in terms of price/performance. 1440p offers clear benefits over 1080p, and the difference between 1440p and 4k is negligible (in my opinion). 1440p TVs don't really exist, and a 4k/120hz TV will likely be too expensive.\n\n## Gotchas\n1. **Input latency is lowest at a display's native resolution and refresh rate**. For example, if a monitor's maximum resolution and refresh rate is 1440p/144hz, input lag will likely be higher if outputting at something like 1080p/60hz. This is because the monitor needs to do extra processing to convert the image to a non-native resolution or refresh-rate. So, on your PC or console, ensure that your settings are taking advantage of your display's capabilities\n\n2. **Take notes of the manufacturer's warranty policy.** Buying a TV is pretty easy: you can usually go to a physical store, pick one out, and return it if something goes amiss. But when hunting for a specific gaming monitor, you may have to resort to buying one online. Therefore, when things go wrong, you may be stuck talking directly to the manufacturer. Certain companies like MSI, ASUS, and Razer are an absolute pain to deal with, and some have asinine warranty policies. For example, ASUS believes that selling a monitor with 4 dead pixels is \"acceptable\", while I happen to think it's \"illegal\". Therefore, make sure you know what your rights are as a consumer.\n\n3. **Be wary of TV's that claim 120FPS.** There are some TVs out there that CLAIM to support 120FPS content, but don't actually do so. They instead do something called \"motion interpolation\", otherwise known as the \"soap opera effect\", which is an algorithm that takes in 60FPS content and, using math and machine learning, inserts new frames into the content based on the differences between each frame. While this is admittedly cool piece of technology, motion interpolation is flawed because the frame it generates is an approximation, and more importantly, **the entire process takes time to compute**. Therefore, it adds a TON of input latency. So to ensure that your TV actually supports 120hz content, check for HDMI 2.1 support.\n\n## A Counterpoint: Will We Actually Get 4K/120FPS Games?\n<div class=\"imageContainer medium\">\n  <img class=\"medium\" :src=\"'/craig-the-brute.png'\" />\n    <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">They promised 4K/120FPS and we got...this.</span>\n</div>\n\nI need to make one final point before you all go out and by the newest LG ABCD696969 4K3D 120HZ TV. Recall that, during the previous generation (i.e. Xbox One and PS4), we were promised 4K/60FPS, but the vast majority of games never got anywhere *close* to that rendering target.\n\nThen, when the Xbox One X and PS4 Pro came out, both companies were like, \"OK, no, for real this time, we gonna do 4K/60FPS\", and yet both consoles STILL didn't live up to that claim: they often faked it using techniques like dynamic resolution (i.e. \"**up to** 4K\") or [checkerboard rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkerboard_rendering). Hell, the PS4 Pro's flagship game, God of war, [needed to bump the resolution down](https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/12/17227946/god-of-war-ps4-pro-60fps-4k-1080p) to 1080p so that it could reach 60FPS.\n\nI understand that character models and textures keep increasing in complexity, which eats into the resolution and graphics budget. I also understand that there's marketing pressure to increase image fidelity over image fluidity, as it's hard to convey 120FPS via static screenshots. Consumers want to see the <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'No, this is not a real metric.'\">GigaPoly Bitmapper Shader Units</text-with-tooltip> go *up*, not *down*. Or at least, that's what the marketing department for every single big tech company on the planet thinks, anyway.\n\nRegardless, over-promising and under-delivering is not a new trend in this space, so I advise you to keep your expectations low. Expect games to be rendered **up to** 4K/120hz, but for the majority of them to render far below that for the majority of the time.","dir":"/articles","path":"/articles/how-to-buy-a-display-for-gaming","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2025-05-23T02:54:32.425Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1749094363779},"$loki":7},{"slug":"handling-blank-wkwebviews","title":"Handling Blank WKWebViews","summary":"iOS's WKWebview is a massive improvement over the now-deprecated UIWebView, but I've noticed that they occasionally fail to render, seemingly at random times.

But I recommend you read this entire post if you want a full understanding of the issue and its solutions.\n\n## How WKWebViews Work\nMany teams have had the displeasure of being forced to migrate from UIWebViews to WKWebViews. While the amount of work is not trivial, I think that the changes themselves are relatively straightforward, and usually bring with them memory and speed improvements. \n\nThere's something *very* different, however, about WKWebViews when compared to UIWebViews:\n**When you initialize a WKWebView, a process *outside* of your application's main process gets created.** \n\nThis external process manages the rendering of your web content, and exists separate from your app's main process. You can actually see WKWebView's process when running your app in an XCode simulator: start your app, initialize a view that instantiates a WKWebView, and look in Activity Monitor for something with the name \"WebContent\" in it. You'll notice that, if you kill the process, your app's webview will turn blank (this is a great way to test your failure handling logic!).\n\nThat process's memory doesn't count towards the memory that your app uses, so if your webview uses a lot of memory, your app won't necessarily get killed or receive a memory warning. Instead, iOS will simply kill the WebContent process.\n\nOn one hand, this is great because the death of a webview process doesn't necessarily mean the death of your entire app. But the downside is that, when problems occur with your WKWebView instances, your code will need to be able to gracefully handle these failure scenarios. Otherwise, when a WKWebView crashes, your users will often see an ugly, blank white screen.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img class=\"\" :src=\"'/blankwkwebview.jpg'\" />\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">An iOS component that uses WKWebView in the center to display information. It has just crashed, which is why it's just a white rectangle. <a href=\"https://blog.embrace.io/bug-of-the-month-blank-webviews/\">Taken From embrace.io</a></span>\n</div>\n\nEven if your iOS and HTML/JS code is [simple and clean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UigzN-4JR14), there are certain scenarios that will prompt iOS to *kill your webview*. Unhelpfully, Apple doesn't document *why* iOS would ever kill WebContent processes, but from my own testing, I think happens under the following scenarios:\n- **Low system memory**: if a device is running low on memory, iOS may deem it necessary to kill your webview. Note that your app delegate's `applicationDidReceiveMemoryWarning()` function will NOT necessarily be called, since the webcontent process is seperate from your app's process.\n- **Your app has been backgrounded**: just like how your safari tabs sometimes get killed when you've left them alone for a while, your app's webviews will sometimes get killed as well if your app has been left in the background, *even if your app itself hasn't been killed*.\n- **Your webviews are not visible**: if you have a webview that's in a view controller, and that view controller is NOT on top of the view stack, iOS may deem it acceptable for killing. There's absolutely no documentation for this, but I have seen this happen many times in my own apps, especially when memory is low. iOS will prioritize the currently-displaying webview, while killing the ones not currently showing.\n\nOne important note: when I mention memory problems as being a cause for iOS to kill webviews, I don't necessarily mean memory leaks. It could simply mean that your web pages are requesting too much memory, too quickly. Again, Apple doesn't mention any of this in their documentation. This is simply from what I've read and debugged.\n\n**Sounds scary, right?** Webviews randomly dying poses a major problem if the primary interface for your app is a webview. In particular, this is a an issue if you use web-view-based frameworks, such as Cordova or Ionic.\n\n## How WKWebViews Fail\nIn general, I found that there were two ways that WKWebView could fail, manifesting as a blank white screen:\n1. The WebView rendering successfully, but iOS kills its WebContent process at some later point in time (i.e. after being backgrounded, or after returning into view after being invisible).\n2. The WebView never rendering at all.\n\n### Killed After Being Rendered\nThe first case, where the webview loads, but is then later killed, is the easy case. It can largely be attributed to iOS' aggressive memory management, and you can actually handle it pretty gracefully through the delegate callback `WKNavigationDelegate.webViewWebContentProcessDidTerminate`, which is documented [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wknavigationdelegate/1455639-webviewwebcontentprocessdidtermi). I found that something simple like the following works pretty well (pseudo-code, don't copy and paste this):\n```swift\n  public init() {\n    let configuration = WKWebViewConfiguration()\n    self.webView = WKWebView(frame: CGRect.zero, configuration: configuration)\n    webview.navigationDelegate = self;\n    self.webview = webview;\n  }\n\n  ...\n\n  func webViewWebContentProcessDidTerminate(_ webView: WKWebView) {\n    // Some other logic should probably go here\n    // to try to restore state in the webview itself\n    // as best as you can\n    self.webview.reload();\n  }\n```\nWhen iOS terminates your webview, it invokes the delegate callback. When this happens, I found that calling `self.webview.reload()` was enough to restore it. To get even fancier, you can do things like restore the scroll position with `self.webview.scrollView.setContentOffset()`, but the general idea should remain the same.\n\n### Killed Before being Rendered\nThe *second* case of the webview simply showing a white screen from the get-go, however, is MUCH more difficult to track down and handle.\n\nThe tricky part about this second case is that, unlike the first case, the `webViewWebContentProcessDidTerminate` delegate callback is usually NOT called. In addition, no other useful delegate callbacks are invoked either, such as memory warnings. Anecdotally, when I've encountered this issue, memory usage seemed fine, and I didn't see any crash reports or Jetsam Events in the device logs. This case would not happen very often: I would say that, on average, it would happen once for every 200 webview loads. And when I say \"loads\", I mean loading from a file on disk, so this rules out network failures.\n\nIn the past, I used to think that the issue was due to some peculiarity of the app I was working on at the time, rather than WKWebView itself. But just to make sure, I built a simple test app that loads a WKWebView using an HTML file on disk over and over again, and alerts if the contents of the view are blank after some amount of buffer time (i.e. 5 seconds).\n\nSure enough, every single time I ran this app, I'd get the alert that the webview didn't load. Sometimes it would take 2 hours to see the alert. Sometimes it would take 10 minutes. Once, it took 6 hours. But sure enough, out of about 6 runs, it happened all 6 times. \n\nAfter pouring through the device logs (which were exhausting to look at), the only commonality that I saw between all six runs was the following error, right before iOS attempts set the WKWebView's process to foreground priority:\n\n```\nRBSAssertionErrorDomain; code: 2; reason: \"Specified target process does not exist\".\n```\n\nTo me, this implies that iOS had killed the webview process before WKWebView could finish initializing. I know that the process was getting killed because I was able to trace the PID for the WebContent process in the logs: I could see it being created, and then later in the logs, I saw the error above saying that the target process doesn't exist. \n\nBut as to *why* this was happening, I had no idea: perhaps the device had started the process, context-switched to do something else, and then switched back to the app, only to find that the WKWebView process had been killed. So then, why was the iOS delegate callback not being invoked? I had no idea, but perhaps it was because the code to initialize the delegate logic had not been initialized yet, either. But I had no way of knowing for sure.\n\nBut I had stumbled upon [something interesting](https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-plugin-ionic-webview/issues/286): a setting on a private API that forces the webview to always run at foreground priority. Using private APIs usually makes apps ineligible to be submitted to the App Store, but I was curious to see if this would fix the issue in my test app. So, I added the following lines to my test app (again, pseudocode, but the idea remains the same):\n\n```swift\n  let configuration = WKWebViewConfiguration()\n  config.setValue(\"TRUE\", forKey: \"alwaysRunsAtForegroundPriority\");\n  self.webView = WKWebView(frame: CGRect.zero, configuration: configuration)\n```\n\nI ran my test app again for **24 hours** and did not see the alert. So while I don't have definitive proof, I suspect that there is either a bug in WKWebView itself, or a race condition that goes something like this:\n- a web view is initialized\n- a process is spawned for the web view\n- the process is backgrounded briefly because the webview isn't showing (hasn't yet been added to a parent view that's onscreen, or that paren't hasn't been yet been fully rendered)\n- iOS sees this backgrounded process and says, \"eh, it's not being used, lets kill it\".\n- The app is ready to show the webview but the process was just killed. Hence, none of the delegate callback stuff works.\n\nIf true, then this is why setting `alwaysRunsAtForegroundPriority` fixes the problem. The WebContent process is never backgrounded, so that split-second opportunity for iOS to kill the process never happens, leaving your webview [safe and sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47dtFZ8CFo8).\n\nWhile this seems like an easy fix (it MAY also fix case #1 above, although I didn't test that), using that config option isn't a solution unless you're willing to risk getting banned from the App Store (and if that happens, where else are you gonna sell your app? That's an article for another day).\n\n## My Solution(s)\nSo I decided to do something different: taking inspiration from [this snippet I found on GitHub](https://github.com/IjzerenHein/WKWebView/blob/master/src/ios/MyMainViewController.m), I added logic to periodically check if the webview had died. It looked something like this (pseudo-code, don't copy and paste):\n```swift\n  public init() {\n    let configuration = WKWebViewConfiguration()\n    self.webView = WKWebView(frame: CGRect.zero, configuration: configuration)\n    webview.navigationDelegate = self;\n    self.webview = webview;\n\n    // Every 3 seconds, check if the webview is dead. If it is, reload it.\n    self.timer = Timer.scheduledTimer(timeInterval: 3, \n      target: self, selector: #selector(checkForDeadWebViews),\n      userInfo: nil, repeats: true);\n  }\n\n  ...\n\n  func checkForDeadWebViews() {\n    // TODO: There needs to be synchronization logic here: we don't want\n    // webViewWebContentProcessDidTerminate firing twice!\n    if (self.webview.title?.isEmpty) {\n       self.webViewWebContentProcessDidTerminate(self.webView);\n    }\n  }\n\n  func webViewWebContentProcessDidTerminate(_ webView: WKWebView) {\n    self.webview.reload();\n  }\n```\n\nSince my app was in complete control of its web content, I knew that every webview had a title. So if a webview DIDN'T have a title, then I knew that something had gone wrong, and I needed to reload the entire webview.\n\nThis WOULD have worked well, but there was one problem! While `webview.reload()` worked fine for the case where iOS was killing our WebContent process and invoking the delegate callback, I found that it didn't do ANYTHING for the second case! Calling `webview.reload()` simply did nothing, which was extremely unfortunate. Instead, I found that I had to do something like the following:\n\n```swift\n  public init() {\n    // ... Stuff I only want to initialize once\n    self.initializeWebView();\n  }\n\n  function initializeWebView() {\n    let configuration = WKWebViewConfiguration()\n    self.webView = WKWebView(frame: CGRect.zero, configuration: configuration)\n    webview.navigationDelegate = self;\n    self.webview = webview;\n\n\n    if (self.timer != nil) {\n      self.timer.invalidate();\n    }\n\n    // Every 3 seconds, check if the webview is dead. If it is, reload it.\n    self.timer = Timer.scheduledTimer(timeInterval: 3, \n      target: self, selector: #selector(checkForDeadWebViews),\n      userInfo: nil, repeats: true);\n  }\n\n  func checkForDeadWebViews() {\n    if (self.webview.title?.isEmpty) {\n       self.webViewWebContentProcessDidTerminate(self.webView);\n    }\n  }\n\n  func webViewWebContentProcessDidTerminate(_ webView: WKWebView) {\n    self.initializeWebView();\n  }\n```\n\nIf it's not clear, the difference between this snippet and the earlier one is that, instead of simple calling `reload()` on the webview, I am constructing an entirely new webview, along with a new timer. This is undoubtedly a heavier solution, but I found that simply throwing the old webview away and creating a new one effectively worked around the issue. \n\nThe end result of my solution is that, on the off chance that iOS kills my webviews and I actually get alerted about it, the view gets restored in a mostly-transparent fashion. When iOS kills my webview before I even get a chance to display it, this manifests to the user as a view that takes a little longer to load than normal. \n\nThis sucks, but honestly, users are used to this. As an iphone/safari user myself, pages randomly taking a long time to load is a daily occurrence for me. It's annoying and frustrating, and as a developer, you wish that there was a better alternative, but it is what it is.\n\n## Summary\nThis post isn't a dig at Apple (I'm sure it's the same, if not worse, for Android phones). It's just a reminder of how complicated these devices and their associated software can be, and the lengths that companies like Apple have gone to make programming for their devices as easy as possible. Want to display a web page in your app. Sure, it's three lines of code! Go crazy! It's commendable, but those abstractions can be leaky at times. \n\nOne final note: if anyone has any suggestions or improvements, *please* include them in the comments below. I'd love to hear about your experiences with WKWebView, and how you've dealt with these problems (or maybe you've *never* dealt with these problems, and I just write terrible code!)\n","dir":"/articles","path":"/articles/handling-blank-wkwebviews","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2025-05-23T02:54:32.425Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1749094363808},"$loki":8},{"slug":"why-start-a-blog-in-2020","title":"Why Start a Blog in 2020?","summary":"Is there any point to starting a blog in 2020, as opposed to starting a YouTube channel?

Much like how music aggregation services harm artists, content aggregation services harm content creators for all the same reasons: content creators live or die by the hands of these huge, powerful tech companies, and only the big players at the top have any real chance at getting their content noticed. This is because big corporations are the only ones with enough money to employ tactics like:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n   <b>Paying for Preferential Treatment</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n      Google, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and other content aggregators allow people to pay to get their content seen by a wider group of people.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n    <li>\n    <b>Paying for Advertising and Sponsorships</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n      Advertising sucks, but it works. Small content creators can't afford to spend money on advertising, but the big brands can spend millions on it.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <b><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing\" target=\"_blank\">Astroturfing</a></b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n      It's criminally easy to pay a few hundred people to post reviews about your content, acting as real, unbiased customers, and have it appear like the general population is genuinely interested in your product. Companies exploit websites like reddit and twitter to manufacture a positive consensus about a product <i>all the time</i>.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\nThese tactics, plus many more, mean that groups and organizations with deep enough pockets and influence wield significant power on these content aggregation platforms. For example, take a look below at a screenshot I took of Reddit's \"Top Post\" as of November 19th 2020, around noon. It's literally just a thinly-veiled advertisement for a pizza chain:\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/ad.PNG'\" />\n    <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">I blocked out the actual company so you wouldn't have to be subjected to the actual advertisement.</span>\n</div>\n\nDoes anyone think that this advertisement for pizza reached it's top spot organically? Do we really think 34,000 people saw this and thought to themselves that this post was so compelling, that they thought to upvote it over all other pictures they saw that day? Or is it possible that the company that owns this pizza chain employed one or more of the methods I mentioned above?\n\nNot only is seeing a pizza advertisement as reddit's top post *lame*, but it also actively harms small content creators who would have otherwise had a opportunity for world-wide exposure. There were probably thousands of pictures from real people that were more deserving of that top spot, but the unfortunate reality is that these small-time creators didn't have the money or connections to exploit reddit like *\\<redacted fast food company\\>* did.\n\nTo drive this point home, here's another anecdote: I booted up [twitch.tv](twitch.tv) last night (a site where you can watch people play video games), which I generally think is pretty cool because its a pretty democratic platform. But I was shocked to see something featured prominently on the homepage, front-and-center over all other content. Was it:\n1. An independent streamer playing Fornite?\n2. Pewdiepie meme'ing around with his friends?\n3. An attractive female with millions of followers?\n\nAll good guesses, but no. **It was an NFL game**. \n\nIf I'm small, independent content creator on twitch, then *how the hell* am I supposed to get any visibility when Twitch has the *freaking NFL* on their homepage?\n\nWhen a handful of companies control how content and information get consumed for the majority of the population, then the playing field becomes ripe for exploitation and manipulation by the biggest voices. The end result is that the biggest brands get seen and heard, while the smaller, independent voices get silenced and buried.\n\nFor someone like me, this is pretty sad: in real life, I'm a pretty closed off individual. Introverted, you could say. But like most other human beings on the planet, I want to engage in discourse. I want to discuss, debate, listen, and learn. And maybe laugh at a cute dog video or two. For people like me, the internet used to be a great place to do that. But unfortunately, I'm beginning to feel less comfortable, and less motivated, doing so on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit that are designed to stamp out little, independent voices like my own. And for what? Pizza advertisements? NFL Games? \n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/rain.PNG'\" />\n    <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">Remember <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwTZ2xpQwpA&feature=emb_title\" target=\"_blank\">Choclate Rain</a>? What about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0\">Friday?</a> Are genuine, viral phenomena like this even possible any more, when so much of Youtube's platform is dominated by big players?</span>\n</div>\n\n### Taking my Blog and Going Home\nTherefore, instead of posting something to reddit, twitter, youtube, or facebook, and giving these big tech companies free content to monetize, analyze, and sell to advertisers, I want to start \"selling\" my own cassette tapes of tech content to take some power back. I want to start a shift back to the way the internet used to be, where smaller voices could actually reach people. Where content could simply exist on the internet without a monetary purpose, without a desire to collect your data, where content doesn't simply exist for advertisers to analyze and aggregate into a dystopian, consumerist black hole. Admittedly, I'm shouting into the void, but change can't start from nothing. For me, that change starts with this post.\n\nLike musicians taking their music off Spotify and selling their physical music directly to consumers, I am taking my content (as little and worthless as it may be) and putting it on my own platform. My hope is that, if people take their content away from big content aggregation platforms and decentralize it, the power shifts a little more fairly back into the hands of the content creators, where it belongs.\n\n**So, I'm starting a blog.** Ideally, it should be a video blogging platform, but that would take a ton of time to implement, and I'm not that smart. And as far as videos go, I'm not really funny, personable, or creative with editing. So, a blog it is!","dir":"/articles","path":"/articles/why-start-a-blog-in-2020","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2025-05-23T02:54:32.429Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1749094363832},"$loki":9},{"slug":"play-this-eternal-sonata","title":"Play This, Not That: <i>Eternal Sonata</i> Vs. <i>Tales of Symphonia</i>","summary":"The first episode of (hopefully) a series of blog posts that pits games from older generations against each other, with a recommendation to play one, but not the other.

Originally published by Bandai Namco in 2004, it's seen several re-releases since then: it was ported to the PS2, then to the PS3, and then finally to PC.\n\nI, on the other hand, had a weird curiosity for **Eternal Sonata**, a JRPG for the Xbox 360 (and later PS3). This game was *also* published by Bandai Namco, and was released in 2007 (and later ported to the PS3 in 2008).\n\nInterestingly, *both* of these games offer local co-op: a second player can control one of the party members during battle. So, as closet lovers of anime melodrama and cliched romances, what did we do? We played *both* of them, of course! What did we think of them? Read on to find out!\n\n<accent-box>\nOne point before I begin: you may object to my critiques with \"these games were good at the time! You can't judge them by 2021 standards!\", but I think that's missing the point. My intent with this post is to help readers answer the question, \"Is this game fun?\" rather than \"Was this game fun in the year 2004?\"\n</accent-box>\n\n## *Tales of Symphonia*: Woefully Out of Tune\n<div class=\"imageContainer imageUnderSection\">\n  <img :src=\"'/symph.jpg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">Tales of Symphonia's battle system is fast and fun, but that's probably it's biggest (and only) strength. Image Credit: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rpgsite.net/review/3346-tales-of-symphonia-chronicles-review\">RPGSite</a></span>\n</div>\n\nLet me set the stage: my fiancée and I were absolutely *pumped* to play this game. It consistently ranks very highly on \"Best Of Tales Series\" lists such as [this one](https://www.thegamer.com/best-tales-games-ranked/), where it's ranked as the 2nd best *Tales* game [of all time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUHQpCM7yyY). Owing to its constant online praise, we were eager to get this Symphonic party started.\n\nHaving said that, we also knew that we'd have to temper our expectations. The game *is* over 15 years old: game design, art, and graphics have dramatically improved since 2004. We wanted to give this game a fair chance, so we tried to keep its age in mind.\n\nBut despite our best attempts to play the game as if we were [Caprisun drinking](https://parents.caprisun.com/), [yogurt yogurt slurping](https://www.yoplait.com/product-category/gogurt/) preteens in the 2000's, we both quickly realized that this game has *not* aged well.\n\nThis isn't to say that the game is irredeemable. It has its strengths, such as:\n* It's fast, fluid, and fun real-time battle system.\n* The chemistry between the characters during random conversations (called \"skits\" in *Tales* parlance). It's fun to watch the main cast bicker and banter over trivial things. This is where *Symphonia's* cast shines, as these are the only times in the game where the characters seem *human*. \n* An interesting narrative premise, in theory.\n\nBut as a cohesive whole, the game is massively flawed. It's tedious, frustrating, and outright disrespectful to the player's time. While there are many issues with this game, I would summarize it as one main critique: **a linear experience with no hook.**\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/symph3.jpg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">When playing <i>Tales of Symphonia</i>, expect lots and lots of awkward, boring dialog as you get shuttled from town to town. Don't be fooled by the game's opening, either: roughly half of the game's dialog isn't voice-acted.</span>\n</div>\n\n\"Linear\" RPGs, or ones that restrict exploration and player freedom, get a bad rap in Western circles. Many of us are used to huge, open-ended RPGs that actively encourage exploring and getting diverted off the main path (Elder Scrolls, Fallout, etc). As a result, we tend to complain when RPGs restrict our freedom. Whether its deserved or not, JRPGs are stereotyped as linear experiences, and some unfairly equate that to \"JRPGs are bad\".\n\nI'd argue that linearity isn't necessarily a bad thing: many great games use linearity to craft focused, memorable experiences for the player. Halo, Call of Duty, God of War, Uncharted, Final Fantasy, and Paper Mario are all of examples of single-player experiences that don't allow for much unguided exploration, and are undoubtedly some of the greatest games ever made.\n\nBut for linear game designs to pay off, there needs to be a \"hook\". Whether that hook is gameplay (i.e. exciting action sequences), story-driven (i.e. cutscenes, major plot events), or something else, the game needs to be able to entice the player to go along with its linear structure. \n\nFor example, *Zelda* games reward players for completing dungeons (which are fun on their own) with cool items, interesting plot developments, and lore revelations. *Halo* rewards players for completing its objectives with bad-ass cutscenes and impressive in-game set-pieces. Linear games *need* these hooks, and without something to compel the player into following along, games tend to start feeling like chores rather than games.\n\nDespite its fun battle system, *Tales of Symphonia* definitely lacks any kind of hook. As a story-driven RPG, the game's presentation fails for a number of reasons:\n* **The Story:** it's interesting in theory, but its execution is an absolute mess. I won't attempt to summarize the game's story here because that would be impossible. The game's narrative is simply too convoluted. In addition, the game attempts to tackle themes like Sacrifice, Betrayal, Genocide, and Legacies, but fails to convey any of them well. \n* **The Backtracking:** *Symphonia* often forces the player to march back and forth (and sometimes back again) between towns. I wouldn't even call these \"fetch quests\" because there's often no battling involved. Your reward for this is story exposition dumps and dialog-heavy cutscenes. My suspicion is that this was done to pad out the game's length so it could claim \"40 hours of gameplay\" on the back of its box.\n* **The Cutscenes:** speaking of cutscenes, the game's voice-acted dialog ranges from inoffensive to painful, and characters are either stiffly animated or not at all. It's common to see a character's smiling face in the background of a serious cutscene, and it looks ridiculous.\n* **The Script:** the game's script is too on-the-nose, and is very awkward to hear out loud. Characters *constantly* explain their feelings and motivations (violating the Golden Rule of Storytelling, \"Show, don't Tell\"), which makes them seem robotic and unnatural. Villains are laughably one-note, calling the main cast \"Inferior Beings\" at every opportunity.\n\nAt this point, you may be wondering, \"Why are you harping over this game's presentation? Does it really matter as long as it's fun to play?\" Well, it matters because **when playing *Symphonia*, you'll be reading/listening more than you'll be RPG-ing**. \n\nI'd estimate that the majority of my time with *Symphonia* was spent pressing \"A\" to advance text, rather than traversing dungeons, battling enemies, or doing RPG-esque inventory management. This is fine on its own, but pure torture when you're playing a game with a presentation as terrible as *Symphonia's*. \n\nTherefore, because *Symphonia* places so much of its worth on its presentation, the game falls flat. And being produced in 2004 is no excuse: if they didn't have the technology or budget to produce a game with a good story, voice acting, or animation, then they shouldn't have attempted to make a game mostly comprised of cutscenes.\n\n<youtube-link :src-link=\"'https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_J37az8fHTw'\">\n<b>This video contains a minor spoiler.</b> A sample of the type of dialog that you'll have to endure for 40+ hours. This scene is often regarded as a cool, bad-ass moment by the Tales community, but to me, it comes off as laughably stiff. \n</youtube-link>\n\nOkay, so the game fails to hook the player with its presentation. But this is a videogame! Surely the game is fun to play?\n\nNot exactly. As mentioned above, the battle system *is* fun in small sessions, but it collapses under the weight of the game's awful dungeon design, which consists of:\n* Hoards of respawning enemies that pose little threat, making each battle feel unrewarding.\n* Unimaginative puzzles that you've already seen in a million other games. Sliding block puzzles, liquid-running-down-pipe puzzles, raise/lower water-level puzzles, you name it, it's here. None of them are fun or imaginative.\n* Dungeons require a hefty amount of back-tracking and are maze-like in design, which exacerbates the points above.\n* You *will* be underleveled when you fight bosses for the first time, so make sure you put aside even *more* time for grinding.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/block.jpg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">Do you like sliding block puzzles? If so, then you're in luck! Tales of Symphonia is filled with unimaginative puzzles like this.</span>\n</div>\n\nBecause of the aforementioned backtracking, over-leveled bosses, and respawning enemies, battles become more of an annoyance than something to enjoy. In fact, I found myself avoiding battles simply so I could get through dungeons as fast as possible (exacerbating the boss problem). And when I'm avoiding battles, lamenting having to endure time-wasting puzzles, and dreading boss battles (and the ensuing grind required to progress), there's nothing that a fun battle system could ever do to save this game.\n\nTherefore, with a lack of any compelling hook in either the game's presentation or its battle system, the game becomes a chore to play. This is a shame because there seems to be a *lot* of people that love this game. Maybe I'm missing something? Or maybe it's nostalgia, and I simply didn't drink enough Caprisuns? I'll never know for sure.\n\n**Nevertheless, my advice is:** don't play this game unless you want a history lesson for the *Tales* series. Doubly so if you're looking for an entry point in the *Tales* franchise: the games that came after this are objectively better in almost every way (i.e. *Tales of Vesperia* or *Tales of the Abyss*), and there's no story continuity between games to worry about.\n\n**My Rating:** 2 Inferior Beings out of 5\n\n## *Eternal Sonata*: a Flawed, yet Refreshing, Change of Tempo\n<div class=\"imageContainer imageUnderSection\">\n  <img :src=\"'/sonata.jpg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">This game is far from perfect, but its presentation is absolutely beautiful at times.</span>\n</div>\n\nIn contrast to *Symphonia's* dedicated online following, not many people seem to care for, or even remember, *Eternal Sonata*. The game is rarely discussed in forums and gaming news sites, and none of our gaming friends had ever even *heard* of it. This may be due to the fact that, despite being a highly-anticipated game before its release, [the game received lukewarm reviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_Sonata#Reception) by both players and critics. Even so, I wanted to give this game a shot because it seemed *different*.\n\nFor those who haven't heard of this game, here's a basic summary: Frederic Chopin, the brilliant (real-life) piano composer, is dying, and the entirety of the game takes place in his dreams as he lies on his deathbed. The player takes control of a group of characters, including Chopin, that try to make sense of this fantastical, yet cruel, dream world. Much like its premise, the game's presentation takes on a fantastical, ethereal look that is, at times, amazing to witness.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/polka.gif'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">Despite its age, the game has a attractive, storybook quality, which lends itself well to the game's dreamworld motif.</span>\n</div>\n\n*Eternal Sonata's* premise is objectively outrageous, and to me, it seemed inevitable that this game would devolve into silliness and absurdity. But from the moment I started the game, I realized that the game's creators *weren't screwing around*: it's clear that a lot of care and diligence went into ensuring that this game was an adequate tribute to Chopin and his legacy. For starters, the developers [consulted the Frederic Chopin Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_Sonata#Development) to ensure that they were depicting a thematically-accurate representation of Chopin's life. \n\nThe game also punctuates the end of each chapter with history lessons for the player about Chopin's real life, with his music accompanying real-life imagery. While it sounds bizarre, it works surprisingly well: these moments were something that my fiancée and I looked forward to as we progressed through the game. While it may not seem like it at first glance, these history lessons also have subtle, yet interesting, connections to the game's main storyline. Things like this make *Eternal Sonata* a little weird, but refreshingly different and thoroughly *earnest*.\n\nTo be clear, though, the game is *not* biographical: real-life Chopin never led a zany cast of anime characters through a desert to find a magic crystal, nor could he bring monsters to their knees with a swing of his baton (Chopin was *not* a conductor). Chopin's appearance is particularly silly: he looks like a wispy anime boy band member rather than a piano composer. But that's not really the point.\n\nRather, the point of the game is about exploring Chopin's life, and how it says something about our own lives, what it means to live, and what it means to die. It speaks to the power of memories and legacies, all while using Chopin's music as an emotional amplifier. His music is saved for the game's heaviest moments, and they're utilized to great effect. \n\nSeriously, it's wild to me that this game, despite its flaws (which I'll get to in a sec), gets so many things *right:*\n* **The Environments:** the game's landscapes and scenery are wonderful to look at. In an era where most games on the 360/PS3 were coated in drab, greyish-brown hues, *Eternal Sonata* uses color to great effect. \n* **The Character Animations:** the game's main characters move and emote very convincingly. Despite veering into [uncanny-valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley) territory at times, the characters' faces convey a *ton* of emotion. This helps the game mitigate its adequate, but sometimes uneven, voice work.\n* **The Music:** as expected, the game's music is phenomenal. The game's final end-credits song stands out as one of the greatest pieces of videogame music I've ever heard.\n* **The Sound:** forests creak and chirp with life, towns bustle underneath the whirring of windmills, and sewers drip and echo. When compared to a game like Symphonia, which features no ambient sounds or noise whatsoever, the difference is stark. Few games that I've played pay this much attention to ambient sound design.\n* **The Battle System:** The game's turn-based battle system is unique and enjoyable, for the most part. The Light/Shadow mechanic is particularly engaging (attacks have different effects when your player is cast in shadow).\n* Without spoiling anything, the game's narrative isn't afraid to let the player think for themselves, unlike *Symphonia*, which beats its players over the head with what it wants you to think and feel.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/polka.jpg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">Aside from some uncanny-valley-esque eye movements, the characters show a ton of emotion through their faces alone.</span>\n</div>\n\nNeedless to say, this game absolutely *nails* its presentation. While not every second of *Eternal Sonata* is perfect (in particular, some of its monologues are a little too self-indulgent), its art design, sound, and animations are immensely enjoyable. This is important because, like *Symphonia*, *Eternal Sonata* spends a lot of its time in cutscenes.\n\n*Eternal Sonata* is at its best when its free to flex its artistic muscles, but suffers from some of the same gameplay problems that *Symphonia* does. Its dungeon designs, for example, tend to be narrow, linear passages that force the player through enemies that spawn a *little* too often. This is compounded by the fact that, despite being enjoyable at face-value, the game's battles last a *little* too long.\n\nTo be clear, the game's battle system *is* fun: I enjoyed unlocking new abilities for each of the game's characters, and I was eager to try them out in battle. In addition, the battle system's mechanics actually change (i.e. get harder but more rewarding) as you progress, which helps keep things fresh. But during long play sessions and especially in dungeons, the game's battles will likely start to wear on the player. *Symphonia* fares better in this regard because of its real-time nature: there's no downtime when in battle, and this makes the player feel engaged and entertained for the battle's entirety. \n\n*Eternal Sonata*, on the other hand, forces you to sit through each enemy's turn, which can sometimes lead to waiting periods of over 30 seconds. This isn't a problem when the enemy encounter rate is manageable, but in dungeons, battles will probably start grating on the player's nerves. Therefore, like Symphonia, *Eternal Sonata* dungeons are inconvenient at best and a time-consuming chore at worst.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/sontata-battle.jpg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\"><i>Eternal Sonata's</i> turn-based battle system is fun, but there's a lot of downtime to endure as enemies take their turns.</span>\n</div>\n\n\nAlso like *Symphonia*, *Eternal Sonata's* dialog is a little wonky, and its script is also too \"on-the-nose\" (the opening cutscene flat-out asks the player \"can we really distinguish between dreams and reality\"). Lines that may have *read* fine in the script sound very stilted and unnatural when spoken out loud by voice actors that sometimes struggle to convey the appropriate tone.\n\n*Eternal Sonata* is also extremely linear, perhaps even more so than *Symphonia*. But unlike *Symphonia*, *Eternal Sonata* has a \"hook\": I was eager to power through dungeons so that I could experience more of the game's presentation: the Chopin history lessons, the game's landscapes and vistas, the entertaining cutscenes and animations, and the wonderful music were significant enough motivators for me to trudge through the game's weaker moments. Unlike *Symphonia*, which I begrudgingly finished and felt very little at the game's conclusion, I felt a *lot* of things by the time I finished *Eternal Sonata*. I felt a sense of relief, gratitude, hope, and even sadness. \n\nI don't mean to say that I wish the game was longer: it was neither too short nor too long. Rather, my point is that the game expertly juxtaposes life, death, love, heartache, nostalgia, and pain with its story to complement the bittersweet tones of Chopin's music. To that end, this game succeeds in chronicling the life of Chopin, the brilliant Polish composer, as well as Chopin, the young man who lived a tumultuous life and died too early. \n\n<youtube-link :src-link=\"'https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/g8hYaMiiw3M'\">\nChopin's \"Raindrop\" is one of his real-life pieces that is featured in <i>Eternal Sonata</i>. It's a beautiful piece, and used to great effect.\n</youtube-link>\n\nI often judge a game's story by one simple metric: how much am I thinking about it in the days/weeks after I finish it? For *Symphonia*, not at all. For *Eternal Sonata*? At least a few days, if not a week or so. This metric speaks volumes about *Eternal Sonata's* success at creating a captivating, memorable experience.\n\nBefore I get ahead of myself and call *Eternal Sonata* a masterpiece (it's not), I'll leave it at this: it's a game that, despite it's flaws, succeeds at what it sets out to do. If you have even a slight appreciation for art and/or music, then you owe it to yourself to give this game a chance. At the very least, if you've become bored with this decade's endless sea of looter-shooters and empty open-worlds (excluding *Breath of the Wild*, as that game is a masterpiece) and are looking for something different, I'd recommend *Eternal Sonata* as a pleasant palette cleanser.\n\n**My Rating:** 4 Creepy, yet Beautiful, Anime Eyes out of 5.","dir":"/articles","path":"/articles/play-this-eternal-sonata","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2025-05-23T02:54:32.426Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1749094363875},"$loki":10},{"slug":"running-wsl2-on-bootcamp","title":"Running WSL2 on a Mac using Bootcamp","summary":"Getting Microsoft's Windows Subsystem-For-Linux running in Bootcamp is somewhat straightforward, but there are a few gotchas.

[Get it Here!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reddirect-for-reddit/id6478085041)\n\n## Overview\nPut simply, Reddit is awesome. Whether you're looking for advice, opinions, information, or simply something to laugh at, reddit has you covered. I've been an avid user for over 10 years, and I can't imagine my life without it.\n\nBut unfortunately, Reddit Inc has been making tons of user-hostile changes over the years, starting with its infamous site redesign and culminating towards [killing off all third party apps](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/reddits-new-api-pricing-will-kill-off-apollo-on-june-30/). Becoming fed up with these changes, I decided to take matters into my own hands.\n\nSo, without further ado, here's \"Reddirect\" (sigh....\"For Reddit\")! Reddirect is an iOS Safari extension that optimizes the reddit experience on iOS platforms. The app takes a minimal, but effective, approach in improving the reddit experience on mobile devices.\n\nThey say a picture is worth a thousand words, so take a look at reddit on the iPhone as it normally appears:\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/oldlight.jpg'\" style=\"height: 500px; object-fit: contain;\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">What is this? An app for ants?</span>\n</div>\n\nThere are *many* problems with old.reddit.com on mobile:\n- Impossible to use without switching to landscape or zooming in\n- Modals are often impossible to submit or close\n- Chat is impossible to use\n- Elements are frequently larger than the viewport\n- Misclicks are extremely common (in my experience) due to how small the site's buttons/links are\n- Ads and useless garbage take up too much of the screen.\n\nThe site was, clearly, not designed for mobile devices.\n\nNow, take a look at old.reddit.com with Reddirect's changes:\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/redditlight.jpg'\" style=\"height: 500px; object-fit: contain;\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">An actually-usable interface!</span>\n</div>\n\nNo more panning, zooming, and rotating your device to  use a text-driven website! No more ads! No more useless clutter taking up 40% of the screen! Video thumbnails automatically resize to fit the width of your screen! Isn't modern web development **amazing?**\n\nAnd here's dark mode, in case you're curious:\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/redditdark.jpg'\" style=\"height: 500px; object-fit: contain;\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">An actually-usable interface!</span>\n</div>\n\n## Changes\nAt a high level, Reddirect makes the following changes to old.reddit.com:\n- Redirects all reddit.com links to \"old.reddit.com\" (i.e. it's \"old\" interface)\n- Removes all custom subreddit themes and styles to force a uniform look and feel\n- Hides the sidebar (which is rarely interacted with, IMO) behind a bottom sheet popup\n- Removes all \"Promoted\" posts and, as well as the nags about signing in, reddit gold, etc\n- Adds a Dark Mode\n- Many more tweaks to make things a little nicer on iOS\n\n## Privacy\nThis app needs a few Safari Permissions to run since it needs to examine and modify the page that the user is on.\n\n**But rest assured:** this plugin does not save, store, or transmit any webpage data to me, Apple, or any third party companies. All webpage and image data stays *directly* on your phone, where it belongs.\n\n## FAQ\n1. **Why does this app cost money?** Because I spent a lot of time on it, and I think software that makes one's life better deserves to be paid for. It also helps me prioritize fixing it when reddit changes things and breaks it.\n\n2. **I think I found a bug! What do I do?** Contact me at <a href=\"mailto:contactme@nevermeant.dev\">contactme@nevermeant.dev</a> with some details on how to reproduce it. I will add your name/tag/whatever in my app as a thanks. \n\n3. **This app sucks! Who do I complain to?** Any and all feedback is appreciated. Contact me about your ideas.\n\n## Closing Remarks\nWhat started as a simple weekend project quickly became a larger undertaking as I began to realize how *ill-suited* old.reddit.com is for small screens. The site uses TONS of hardcoded sizes and makes lots of assumptions about screen sizes: almost every day, I'd find a new rule that I'd have to fix, or a new design challenge to work around.\n\nAfter diving into old.reddit's design, I quickly began to realize *why* reddit had decided to redesign the site from the ground up. I think we can all agree that the end result is *[unequivocally terrible](https://www.reddit.com/)*, but at the very least, I can understand the motivation behind a complete redesign.\n\nDo I think that my app perfects the reddit experience? Probably not. There are likely other bugs and layout quirks that I've missed, or better solutions for things that I overlooked.\n\nNevertheless, I'm proud of how the app turned out. My main metric for measuring the quality of my apps is \"Do I still want to use it?\", and I can emphatically say that I can't imagine using reddit WITHOUT my app.\n\n## Questions?\nFor questions about the app, you can email me directly at: <a href=\"mailto:contactme@nevermeant.dev\">contactme@nevermeant.dev</a>","dir":"/articles","path":"/articles/reddirect-a-safari-extension-for-old-reddit-redirect","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2025-05-23T02:54:32.427Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1749094363893},"$loki":12},{"slug":"game-companies-customer-crap-cyberpunk-2077","title":"Game Companies: Stop Treating your Customers Like Crap","summary":"Game companies consistently make the mistake of taking their customers' passion and dedication for granted, and it often ends in disaster.

Do not direct any hatred at any employees of CDPR, or any of the other companies that I've mentioned in this post. 99% of the people that work at these companies likely just want to make good games.\n\n2. With that said, going out of one's way to buy broken games because \"you should feel sorry for the developers and support the industry\" is simply perpetuating the problem and enabling these greedy companies (i.e. EA, Activision-Blizzard, etc) to continue exploiting their passionate developers, artists, designers, and customers.\n\n3. This post is not outrage bait for Cyberpunk 2077. Please read the entire post before dismissing it as such.\n\n## The Context\nIf you've been out of the gaming loop for the past couple of weeks, you may have missed that Cyberpunk 2077\\'s launch has been an *absolute mess* (on consoles, anyway). Below is my best attempt at a timeline of this game\\'s truly horrible development and subsequent launch:\n\n- Riding high from the success of The Witcher 3, beloved developer CDPR bragged on multiple occasions that their hip game dev studio [doesn't force their employees to \"crunch\"](https://kotaku.com/cd-projekt-red-boss-again-promises-that-cyberpunk-devs-1835518344), which is a cutesy name for the cruel practice of forcing mandatory, grueling overtime on their employees. Unfortunately, such a practice is common in the gaming industry.\n- Cyberpunk 2077, being in development for [roughly 9 years](https://www.gfinityesports.com/article/8658/cyberpunk-2077-how-long-has-it-been-in-development-9-years), was set to release in August 2020, but then delayed to September, then to November, and then to December. In order to meet this December deadline, [the studio went back on their word and forced their company into \"crunch time\"](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/09/30/cyberpunk-2077-devs-backtrack-on-no-mandatory-crunch-stance-report-claims/). Oops.\n- The game goes gold and pre-release copies are sent to media outlets for review. Conspicuously, these reviewers [weren't allowed](https://twitter.com/skillupyt/status/1335999301382639618?lang=en) to use their own footage when writing reviews. In addition, they were only sent PC versions of the game, despite the fact that [41% of the game's pre-orders were for consoles](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/cyberpunk-2077-refund.html). Many, many mainstream game review publications (IGN, gamespot) didn't do *nearly* enough to highlight this fact in their reviews, and showered the game with 9's and 10's.\n- [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/), ever complicit in the vicious cycle of game industry/advertising corruption, had given the Xbox One and PS4 versions of the game a 91/100. This has since been changed, but the damage had been done.\n- Unsurprisingly, the game was released in an [absolutely unacceptable state](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review-ps4-xbox-one-price-size-gameplay-2338569) on PS4 and Xbox One, despite those consoles being the primary targets for the majority of the game's development. Surprisingly, the game also runs [pretty terribly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVWJPYKCMco) on the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X, as well. The game runs OK-ish on PC, as long as you have great hardware.\n- CD Projekt Red [apologizes](https://www.pcmag.com/news/cd-projekt-red-offers-apology-and-refunds-for-cyberpunk-2077) \"for not showing you the game on base last-gen consoles\". In other words, they're sorry for intentionally deceiving 41% of their customers, and getting blasted on the internet for it. They also have the nerve to call PS4/XO \"last-gen\" when the new consoles released just last month, and it's almost impossible to purchase a PS5 or Xbox Series X (they are sold out literally everywhere at the moment, except for absurdly high prices on amazon/ebay)\n- In a move that should be illegal, but for some reason isn't, Microsoft and Sony are [refusing refunds](https://www.t3.com/us/news/cyberpunk-2077-ps4-and-xbox-players-fuming-as-sony-and-microsoft-refuse-refunds_) for the game, telling players to wait for patches. Patches that no one even knows what they'll contain or what they'll address. **UPDATE: in a rare win for the consumer, both companies are now offering refunds. This is likely to avoid legal scrutiny for not allowing digital refunds for all products, period, but a win is a win, I suppose**.\n\nI think that covers most of it. If you can't tell, I don't quite buy the sincerity of their apology, nor do I think that this long list of mistakes can be boiled down to \"aww shucks, guys, we really messed up! We'll strive to do better for our passionate fans next time!\" \n\nRather, I think that every single step that CDPR took was calculated and deliberate with the intention to exploit their employees and consumers as much as possible. Put simply, CDPR simply tried to cash in a huge consumer-goodwill check, and that check bounced.\n\n## From \"Good Guy CDPR\" To Bad Guy \nAs I said above, at the surface, this post is about Cyberpunk 2077, but when you think about the gaming industry, the long bullet-point list above *is really nothing new*. Remember how badly we all hated (or currently hate) EA? Or Ubisoft? Or Activision-Blizzard? These companies' reputations have all been tarnished for similar reasons: they have abused the trust and goodwill of their customers by releasing buggy, broken, unfinished, or otherwise unrepresentative games.\n\nWith that said, then why has the internet's reaction to CDPR and Cyberpunk 2077 been so *visceral* and *emotional*? What makes this different from a typical EA or Activision-Blizzard blunder?\n\nI think that the difference lies in **brand perception**. It's worth noting that companies spend millions of dollars in advertising to establish something known as a [\"Brand Image\"](https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/brand-image/), which is a term to describe how consumers associate ideas, feelings, and imagery to a brand. Getting this right is extremely important for the long-term success of a company because customers will be more willing to spend money on a company's products if they associate positive feelings towards that company.\n\nFor example, what do you think of when I say \"Activision-Blizzard\"? For me, I see vivid imagery of landfills, cocaine, casinos, economic crisis, and depressed children. That probably makes Activision sad, but their actions over the years have cultivated those images in my head. Therefore, as a result of my negative outlook on their brand, I'll likely never buy an Activision-Blizzard product for as long as I live. For those of you reading this article, I'd guess that most of you have a similarly-negative association with the Activision-Blizzard brand for a variety of reasons.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img class=\"\" :src=\"'/kotick.png'\" />\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">This actually happened. Credit to <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/aq3yql/beyond_scummy/\">this reddit post</a></span>\n</div>\n\nCDPR, on the other hand, through sheer hard work and dedication to their craft ([and maybe some help](https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-gets-7-million-government/) from the Polish goverment), had managed to cultivate a much more positive brand image. If we were to repeat that brand-word-association exercise with CDPR before the release of Cyberpunk 2077, I'd imagine that the words that most gamers would come up with would be much more positive.\n\nTherefore, CDPR and the release of Cyberpunk 2077 has made waves across the game industry not because \"game company does scummy, anti-consumer thing\" is newsworthy, but because CDPR had previously been perceived as \"one of the good guys\" among the faceless, soulless, and spineless game companies of the industry. If Cyberpunk 2077 were to be developed by EA, for example, most gamers would simply roll their eyes and cluck their tongues, chastising the young and naive for buying into the hype. But this was *CDPR*. They were *one of us*. I imagine that, for long time fans of the studio, Cyberpunk 2077's blunder felt like a deep betrayal from a long time friend.\n\nThe latest drama from CDPR and Cyberpunk 2077 was especially surprising to me since CDPR could have learned from the *many* game studios before them that had gone from beloved to hated in the span of one game release: Bethesda (Fallout 76), Bioware (Mass Effect: Andromeda, or arguably, Mass Effect 3), Hello Games (No Man's Sky), Blizzard (the Diablo: Immortal Fiasco, or the Warcraft III fiasco), Bungie (Destiny). The list could go on, but the point is clear: someone at CDPR failed to do the necessary literature review.\n\n## Feel the Wrath of the Gamer\nWith that said, why *are* companies like CDPR making the same mistakes that so many companies before them have made? Why have companies like Activision-Blizzard, Bungie, Bioware, and Bethesda thrown away their perceived \"good guy\" brand images so quickly and easily, when it's taken them years, or even decades, to cultivate?\n\nObviously, all of these decisions are driven by the need to make money. I get it: game companies need to make money to function and to produce the products that we enjoy. But why did CDPR need to deceive the public about Cyberpunk 2077? Why couldn't they heed the wise words of Shigeru Miyamoto and delay the game until it was good and ready? In general, why are these companies so flagrant about treating their customers poorly?\n\nOne might argue that the correct answer is often the simplest: game companies simply don't care what gamers think, and just want to make as much money as possible, public perception be damned. Gamer outrage is typically short-lived and typically isn't representative of overall customer sentiment, so I wouldn't blame game companies if they simply ignored it.\n\nDespite this being a simple explanation, however, I don't think that it's accurate: historically, there's been several high-profile cases of public outrage having a **significant** impact on a company's decision making. \n\nFor example, EA's Battlefront II in 2017 outraged many with it's **outright disgusting implementation of the lootbox system in a Star Wars game designed for children, released during the holiday season**. After facing significant backlash that managed to reach mainstream media outlets like CNN and Fox News, they had this to say:\n\n<info-box :source-name=\"'Tweet from EA\\'s official Twitter Account'\" :source-link=\"'https://twitter.com/EAStarWars/status/931332890717143040'\">\nIt's clear that many of you feel there are still challenges in the design. We've heard the concerns about potentially giving players unfair advantages. And we've heard that this is overshadowing an otherwise great game. This was never our intention. Sorry we didn't get this right. We hear you loud and clear, so we're turning off all in-game purchases. We will now spend more time listening, adjusting, balancing, and tuning.\n</info-box>\n\nI don't have the data to prove it, but to be frank, EA could have made a *killing* from this game if they had left their original, highly-predatory, gambling-like system in place. But they must have determined that the outrage and negative sentiment from its customers outweighed the short-term profits gained from this system, and backed out at the last minute.\n\nEA's decision, despite being a single example, suggests that companies *do* care what gamers think, and that negative sentiment *does* have a significant financial impact on game companies. Therefore, I'd argue that theres a different, more subtle reason why companies keep making mistakes that betray their passionate, dedicated fans.\n\n## No One Understands Me\nInstead, I think that companies make consumer-hostile decisions to the detriment of their brand images because of a fundamental misunderstanding of a critical component of the game industry: the customer. In other words, \"the gamer\".\n\nHow can these game companies not understand gamers? First, let me explain how gamers are different from your average consumer: while paradoxical at first glance, I argue that gamers are both undyingly loyal and incredibly fickle at the same time.\n\nIt makes sense when you think about the kinds of products that the game industry offers. No other industry sells a $60 product that can offer tens, hundreds, or even thousands of hours of enjoyment, professional-level storytelling and acting, and cutting edge technology and graphics. No other industry creates worlds and characters that we can both bond with *and* control. No other industry offers a product that gives us all of these features coupled with online infrastructures that allow us to communicate with total strangers or long-time friends in real-time, anywhere in the world. Games can be used a mechanism for competition, as escapism, as a social gathering place, or just to kill time. In my opinion, there's nothing on the market quite as technologically-advanced, engrossing, or immersive as gaming. \n\nAs a result, more than any other industry, the game industry's consumers (i.e. gamers) tend to get personally and emotionally attached to its products and the companies that sell them. Other industries would *kill* for a customer base as loyal, proud, and dedicated as gamers. \n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img class=\"\" :src=\"'/ssc.jpg'\" />\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">A pic from Super Smash Con 2019, a convention where people get together from around the world to play Super Smash Bros. As an attendee myself, the excitement and enthusiasm from the crowd was palpable. Credit to <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/cpdhfl/best_part_of_the_super_smash_con_this_weekend_no/\">this reddit post</a></span>\n</div>\n\nBut because gamers can be so personally and emotionally invested in a company and its products, this *also* means that, more than any other kind of customer, they tend to react much more emotionally when companies  betray them. While this can seem downright immature at first blush, consider it seriously for a second: many of these fans have spent countless hours participating in online forums, reading wikis, writing FAQs, participating in e-sports tournaments, or going to conventions. These fans have made these games or franchises core parts of their lives and their identities, and that's something that should be cherished and celebrated. Frankly, it's awesome and amazing that humans can come together and bond over something in this cruel, meaningless world of ours.\n\nBut to cut corners and betray your consumers as a game company is to signal to these fans that their time, dedication, and passion doesn't matter. It's as if to say, \"We know that you liked our previous games, but we don't care about that. We're simply going to exploit your passion and dedication so that you buy our new game, or spend lots of money on lootboxes to appease our shareholders\". If you were one of these fans, wouldn't you feel, on some level, a little indignant and hurt? Wouldn't it feel like a figurative slap in the face? In that sense, maybe it's a little misguided to call gamers \"immature\" or \"entitled\" when they react a little emotionally when their favorite developer (CDPR) deceptively releases a broken game (Cyberpunk 2077 on consoles).\n\nTherefore, it's especially important for game companies to know this crucial fact about their customers: gamers tend to have an especially-low tolerance for being mistreated. It also doesn't help that gaming isn't a necessity, so unlike cars or appliances, a jilted gamer can simply stop buying your products. Or worse: since gaming concepts aren't copyrightable, gamers can simply find a game that looks or plays similarly from another company.\n\nIn a perfect world, this wouldn't be an issue, as the people making games would typically be gamers themselves. Or at the very least, they'd be able to empathize with their customers, which would allow them to avoiding making decisions that would irreparably damage their relationships with their customers.\n\nBut the harsh reality is that the gaming industry is a [$160,000,000,000 industry](https://www.reuters.com/article/esports-business-gaming-revenues-idUSFLM8jkJMl). There's far too many people in this world that won't let all of that potential money simply sit there, unearned. As a result, people that don't *give a shit* about making great games enter the industry. Gaming is no longer your fun little obscure hobby, and it hasn't been that way for a long time. [It's a business, man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do3iJ6DWvpQ). \n\nAs a result, for many medium-to-large game companies, these kinds of non-gamers tend to be the ones making many of the decisions, while the people who *just want to make good freaking games* go unheard and ignored. And unfortunately, the people that don't care about gaming also don't understand what it means to be personally invested in a game, a franchise, or a game company. These people likely don't even *enjoy* videogames. For example, Activison-Blizzard's CEO, Bobby Kotick, said that he [never actually liked or played videogames](https://www.forbes.com/global/2009/0216/056.html?sh=168bb9d539e4) in a 2009 Forbes interview, something he has furiously backtracked on and denied since then. \n\nPeople like Bobby Kotick, for example, have likely never stared in awe at the sheer absurdity of Super Smash Brothers Ultimate's character select menu and marveled at the possibility that they could now have Sonic, Mario, Ryu and Cloud fight to the death. They've never felt the rush of escaping The Maw in a lone Warthog at the end of Halo, right before the ring's self-destruction. They don't have fond memories of Warcraft III LAN parties every weekend, nor have they ever laughed uproariously while playing Jackbox Party with their non-gamer family.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img class=\"\" :src=\"'/ssb.jpg'\" />\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">Even if you don't enjoy Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, most can recognize the significance of having Mario, Sonic, Ryu, Megaman, and Cloud in the same game. Super Smash Bros is a wonderful, reverent celebration of gaming.</span>\n</div>\n\nI'm not saying that these non-gamers are bad people (well, Bobby Kotick actually *is* a bad person, but that's another article for another day), nor am I gate-keeping the term \"gamer\": a gamer is simply someone who plays videogames, regardless of how much or how little they play. There's also nothing wrong with entering an industry or career with the sole purpose of making money. That doesn't make you or anyone else a bad person.\n\nI'm simply pointing out that there's an obvious disconnect between the people making these short-sighted decisions to chase short-term profits, and the customers that they're supposed to be serving. **To me, it's clear from the numerous, repeated mistakes from once-beloved game companies that there's a clear pattern of undervaluing customer trust in the gaming industry, and this is because games and gamers are different than your typical product/customer.**\n\nTo put it another way, screwing over your customers when you're the CEO of Blizzard is going to be a hell of a lot worse than if you're the CEO of a company like Samsung or DELL. Nobody has an emotional, nostalgic attachment to a Samsung Galaxy or a Dell Ultrasharp Monitor. But when you screw over long time fans of a nostalgic, revered franchise, then there's gonna be major issues.\n\nSo, when a non-gamer has crunched the numbers and has determined that it makes financial sense to ship a broken game, or to make the next game in a beloved franchise a [mobile game instead of a proper PC/console release](https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/5/18064290/blizzard-diablo-immortal-reaction-explainer-blizzcon), or to [cancel an online Super Smash Tournament](https://gamecrate.com/opinion-nintendo-shutting-down-big-house-2020-heartless/26401) in the middle of a global pandemic because they're using a mod to play online, they've likely missed this crucial point: there's an emotional attachment to these games that these management figures don't get. They're unable to empathize with these gamers or the emotional connections that they have, so they have no idea what kind of dollar amount to assign to screwing over their customers. As a result, the calculations and metrics that these management types love to rely on so much usually end up totally off the mark.\n\nWhen these calculations are totally off the mark, terrible things happen: Fallout 76. Mass Effect: Andromeda. Diablo Immortal announced at Blizzcon. And now, Cyberpunk 2077 on consoles. These are all huge, costly mistakes for these companies that I'm sure that they wish they could take back or do over. I'd argue that if they had assigned a greater importance to customer loyalty, they may not have made the same mistakes.\n\n## A Cautionary Tale\nI hope that game companies, including CDPR, finally start to realize how valuable customer trust can be, and how important it is to not abuse that trust. Even though I've spent the last dozen paragraphs criticizing certain game companies, I don't want to see game companies fail. My intent with this post is to bring to light *why* they are failing, and how companies can avoid making these same mistakes in the future. I want to see more great games get made, I want to see more people playing games, and I want to see boundaries being pushed. \n\nBut that can't happen if companies keep making the same grave mistake over and over again. So, listen up, EA's, CDPR's, and Nintendo's of the industry: pay attention to what unfolds after the CDPR Cyberpunk 2077 drama. Take notes on how customers felt betrayed and misled. Study how glaringly transparent it was when reviewers could only use trailer footage in their reviews. Review CDPR's apology that they posted on Twitter, observe how much of a non-apology it was, and see how little effect it had it mollifying gamers' concerns.\n\nFinally, compare and contrast CDPR's sales for Cyberpunk 2077 against the next game that they release. I bet it won't be pretty.\n ","dir":"/articles","path":"/articles/game-companies-customer-crap-cyberpunk-2077","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2025-05-23T02:54:32.424Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1749094363932},"$loki":13},{"slug":"tales-arise-review-flawed","title":"<i>Tales of Arise</i> Review: Bigger (but Not Better) than Ever","titleImage":"/toa_title.jpeg","summary":"This post tales look at Tales Of Arise, examining what it got right, what it got wrong, and where the series might go from here.","titleImageCaptionHTML":"<i>Tales of Arise</i> is one of the few big JRPGs of 2021.

I also completed most of the post-game content. Beating the main game (with lots of sidequests) took me about 60 hours, while the post-game content took me about 10-15 hours.\n* I played the game on the Xbox Series X. I also got to witness first-hand how the game runs on PS4 (my wife was playing it alongside me).\n\n## Introduction: Setting the Stage\n*Tales Of Arise* is the latest entry in the long-running *Tales* series. Developed and published by Bandai Namco, *Arise* was pitched early on as a much-needed evolution for the series. The last two entries, *Tales of Zestiria* (2015) and *Tales Of Berseria* (2017), both received criticism at the time for looking and feeling distinctly last-gen. Both games were simultaneously released for the PS3 *and* PS4, and next to games like *Uncharted 4* (2016), the *Tales* series was starting to look and feel stale.\n\nIn response to that criticism, the development team migrated the series to Unreal Engine 4 and promised to give the *Tales* series a much needed facelift, in addition to higher production values, a more-open world, and an evolution of the game's core mechanics.\n\nHow well did Bandai Namco stick to their promises? Having spent 80+ hours in the world of *Arise*, I think I'm in a good spot to answer that question. But in order to properly summarize those 80 hours, this review may get a little long: I want to praise Bandai Namco for taking a giant leap forward, as well as criticize them for taking several steps back.\n\nWithout further ado, let's get this anime JRPG party started!\n\n## The Good Stuff\n<div class=\"imageContainer imageUnderSection\">\n  <img :src=\"'/toa_good_header.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\"><i>Arise</i> makes a great first impression. Image Credit: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gamerant.com/every-tales-of-arise-trailer-explained/\">Game Rant</a></span>\n</div>\n\nCredit where credit is due: *Arise* makes a fantastic first impression. The game's visual presentation, and especially the use of its [\"Atmospheric Shader\"](https://noisypixel.net/tales-of-arise-more-mature-story-digital-edition/), is excellent. I was initially concerned that the game\\'s use of Unreal Engine 4 would make the game lose its signature watercolor aesthetic, but I think *Arise's* developers found a great middle ground between hyper-realistic and childish. The environments and particle effects have a realistic, yet fantastical, quality to them, and character models look pleasingly anime-esque without looking too cartoony.\n\nCharacter animations are also an amazing sight to behold: characters swing, punch, cast, and slam with a surprising amount of heft. Special moves are flashy and entertaining, even after the 100th time you've seen them. Flame and lightening effect punctuate duo-attacks (called \"Boost Strikes\"), and despite being a little dizzying at times, the game's battles are a fantastic spectacle.\n\nThankfully, despite being flashy and occasionally overwhelming, the game maintains a rock-steady 60 frames-per-second during battles (assuming you're on PS5 or Series X). Major props to the development team for this achievement in an era where most games struggle to maintain 30 FPS.\n\nNarrative-wise, the game's first several hours are also impressive. Rather than spending its first couple hours in a boring, idyllic town like most JRPGs (and even past games in the series), *Arise* gets straight to the point. It begins with a harrowing scene of slaves being tortured and mistreated, followed by a high-octane chase involving one of the game\\'s main female protagonists, Shionne. With liberal use of gorgeous anime cutscenes and a booming orchestral score, the game's opening act forces players to recognize that *Arise* is not like other *Tales* games. It seems to say, \"I'm bigger and better, so you'd better buckle up\".\n\nThe game's visual and narrative upgrades are accompanied by a stellar voice cast. English localizations are often a secondary concern for JRPGs and tend to suffer from poor voice direction: chirpy and over-enthusiastic at best, and cringe-inducing at worst. Thankfully, *Arise* avoids this trend with mature, professional-sounding voice acting. That's not to say that it doesn't have its fair share of anime-induced silliness, but I did appreciate the game's shift to a slightly more serious tone. \n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/toa_battle.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">The game's frantic and frenzied real-time battle system is great fun, albeit in moderately-sized doses. Image Credit: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-arise-preview\">Rock Paper Shotgun</a></span>\n</div>\n\nThe most important element of the *Tales* series, however, is its real-time battle system, and I'm happy to report that it does not disappoint. It's *fast* and (in moderate amounts) very enjoyable.\n\nIn a nod to long-time fans of the series, the battle system returns to its roots of having two distinct types of attacks: normal attacks and special attacks called \"Artes\" (the latter consumes resources so they cannot be spammed). There is also an entirely different set of attacks that can only be performed in the air. Learning how to chain together normal attacks and Artes, both grounded and in the air, to extend combos is challenging and rewarding.\n\nTo keep things fresh, extra skills and Artes are unlocked along the way, which encourages players to experiment with mixing and matching Artes (since you can only equip several at a time) to maximize damage output. In addition, if you get bored of using Alphen, the game's vanilla swordsman, there are 5 other characters you can choose from, which all play very differently from one another. I found myself switching from Alphen to Law (fists) to Rinwell (mage) to Shionne (guns) on a regular basis.\n\nAll in all, *Arise* seriously impresses right out of the gate, and smartly doles out small changes as the game progresses to keep things interesting.\n\n## The Bad Stuff\n<div class=\"imageContainer imageUnderSection\">\n  <img :src=\"'/toa_talk.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">You'll spend a lot of time mostly listening to (but sometimes) reading dialog, which ranges from entertaining to mind-numbing.</span>\n</div>\n\nDespite the game's strong opening, problems begin to emerge as the game progresses. Character dialog begins to bore. Side quests become rote and uninteresting. The story's progression becomes predictable as you enter the 2nd or 3rd zone. In general, after about 10 to 20 hours, the game's Triple-A facade starts to wear away.\n\nThat's not to say that the game absolutely falls apart after 10 or 20 hours (that actually happens a little later, which I'll get to in the next section), but cracks begin to show. To keep things brief, below is a list of issues that I uncovered as I went deeper into the game:\n\n- No local co-op play. Almost every *Tales* game to date had featured the ability for 1, 2, or 3 other players to join the main player in battles, which makes the experience *much* more fun. Disappointingly, *Arise* drops this feature.\n- The music in this game is bland and forgettable. I see the direction they were going for: mature, brooding, and epic. But the soundtrack suffers because of how few tracks there are. And despite despite the small number of tracks, they all sound pretty much the same.\n- Breath of the Wild, this ain't. There are far too many invisible walls, and the vast, open-ended vistas that were showcased in *Arise's* early trailers are actually cramped and restrictive.\n- There's *very* little enemy variety. There's about 6-8 enemy types (excluding bosses) in the entire game, and they're simply reskinned, re-colored, and given buffed up health/strength as you progress.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer imageUnderSection\">\n  <img :src=\"'/toa-enemy.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">Get used to these boar enemies. You'll be fighting them for about 60 more hours. Image Credit: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://samurai-gamers.com/tales-of-arise/charging-zeugle-enemy-list/\">Samurai Gamers</a>\n  </span>\n</div>\n\n- The 2D anime-inspired skits from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/toa_skit_prev.jpeg\">previous tales games</a> are replaced with a 3D comic-book style that re-uses character models. The faces of *Arise's* models lack emotion and seem too robotic, while the 2D faces of earlier games are brimming with personality. Therefore, this is a downgrade in my book.\n- Side quests are mildly interesting at best, and totally disposable at worst. Most sidequests lack voice acting and the rewards are usually inconsequential, appealing only to those looking to aggressively optimize their stats (which is not at all required to beat this game).\n- Graphical pop-in is very noticeable: level geometry and NPCs will pop in and out of view constantly. Most games these days utilize pop-in to keep framerates high, but *Arise's* implementation is particularly aggressive and distracting.\n- Performance on \"last-gen\" consoles is awful: the framerate is unlocked and hovers around 40-50, but dips *hard*, bottoming out at sustained periods of 15-20 during hectic battles.\n- Paid-for DLC (character skins, XP boosts, etc) is dangled in front of you every time that you rest at a campfire. For a series that *used* to include many of these things for free, it comes off as manipulative and slimy. Yes, all big-budget games utilize manipulative tactics like these, but that doesn't make them OK.\n\nThese issues were disappointing to uncover, especially since the beginning of the game hides most of them for the first several hours (DLC nagging, boring sidequests, lack of enemy and music variety).\n\nMy recommendation for readers would be to briefly glance over the bullet-point list above to see if any of these are deal-breakers. If so, then you may as well stop reading. But if not, I recommend continuing to read because I have yet to scratch the surface as to the *major* problems that this game has.\n\n## The Ugly Stuff\nAside from the issues mentioned above, it was around the 25-hour mark that my wide-eyed optimism turned into disdain as I started to see major problems with *Arise's* overall design. Curiously, many of the game's <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-arise-review\">positive</a> <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tales-of-arise-review-wake-me-up-inside/1900-6417727/\">online</a> <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/tales-of-arise-the-kotaku-review-1847682321\">reviews</a> either gloss over these issues or omit them entirely. In my opinion, the obvious conclusion is that, [like always](https://www.denofgeek.com/games/days-gone-actor-sam-witwer-reviews-journalists-controversy/), these reviewers didn't bother to finish the game before sticking their reviews online. \n\nTherefore, as usual, it's up to us regular folk to pick up the slack from these \"professional game journalists\". So, what *exactly* goes wrong around the 25-hour mark? Read on to find out.\n\n### Major Issue #1: Battle System Dissonance\nAs I explained above, *Arise's* battle system is heavily combo-centric: when you successfully land an attack on an enemy, it is briefly stunned, which allows you to safely follow up with another attack. Experimenting with the different types of attacks (normal, Arte, grounded, aerial) to extend combos rewards  players with higher damage output, increased XP gain, and better loot drops.\n\nTo drive home that point, the game keeps a static combo counter on the screen to remind you of this, taunting you to drive that number as high as you can. Combos have always been a fun and rewarding part of *Tales* games, and *Arise* is no exception: the game clearly spells out, through its design and battle mechanics, that combo'ing enemies is how this game is meant to be played and enjoyed.\n\nBut for inexplicable reasons, minibosses (big monster-type overworld enemies) and bosses (human-type special encounters) do not get stunned when hit. Therefore, they simply *cannot* be combo'd in the traditional sense.\n\nInstead, boss battles require you to simply spam 5-10 attacks and then run away before the boss can hit you with its next attack. You'll repeat this process 50-100 times until the enemy is dead. If you get greedy with the number of hits, you'll end up getting smacked. In fact, certain *Artes* with exceptionally long startup times are simply unsafe to use in boss battles, *period*. \n\n<div class=\"imageContainer imageUnderSection\">\n  <img :src=\"'/toa_ganna.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">Boss battles are supposed to be fun, while also testing you on what you've learned so far. In <i>Arise</i>, however, these battles are tedious and frustrating experiences.</span>\n</div>\n\nThe decision to make bosses resistant to staggering throws all of the time you've spent optimizing your strategies and Arte selection for maximum combo potential out the window. And as one would expect, tickling the enemy for 5 seconds and then running away is not fun. Battles grind to a halt and take a drastic turn for the worse as you're forced to peck at enemies to slowly whittle away their health.\n\nSure, the combo counter will probably get pretty high during boss battles, but it's only because one of your party members (who you cannot directly control in battle) managed to hit the enemy while you were running away. If you quickly return to attacking the enemy, your combo will be \"continued\". But this method of \"combo'ing\" feels unpredictable and random, rather than challenging or rewarding. In short, these kinds of battles suck the fun out of the entire experience.\n\nAt this point, you may be asking, \"Why is this a big deal? Aren't boss battles a mere fraction of the game's oerall experience?\". And if this were a normal JRPG, you'd be right: boss battles wouldn't dominate the experience.\n\nBut in *Arise*, something awful happens at the 25-hour mark: minibosses start becoming regular overworld enemies. And at this point, the combo system, which is what makes the game fun and rewarding, stops mattering. Instead, the mind-numbing strategy of hit-and-run becomes the norm. At this point in the game, I found myself wanting to avoid battles *at all costs* due to how boring and *long* they became.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer imageUnderSection\">\n  <img :src=\"'/toa_mantis.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">You'll probably fight this Mantis-lookin' thing about 20 times. Image Credit: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gosunoob.com/tales-of-arise/defeat-mantis/\">Gosunoob</a>\n  </span>\n</div>\n\nWorse still, after around 40 hours or so, the game's later zones contain almost *nothing but minibosses*. There is an *exceptionally* awful stretch at the end of the game where you'll have to trudge through long corridors with unavoidable minibosses around every corner. I have a hard time believing that the developers looked at the last 10 hours of this game and said to themselves with a straight face, \"yep, the player is really gonna enjoy this\". Suffice it to say, I did *not* enjoy it.\n\nIn summary, the game's fun and frantic battle system absolutely crumbles under the weight of these lengthy, monotonous miniboss/boss battles. It's quite a shame because, underneath the bloat and repetition, there is a great battle system in *Arise's* core. But the best battle system in the world can't redeem the utter tedium of this game's latter half, which is crawling with repetitive miniboss battles.\n\n### Major Issue #2: a Bloated, Repetitive Script\nI think this next issue is best illustrated via an example. If you'd rather watch it, check out the vid below (Skip to 8:30. Watch it for 60 seconds; that's all you really need to understand my point):\n\n<youtube-link :src-link=\"'https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/U7xKXb-oAlI?start=510'\">\nA great cutscene that speaks volumes about Shionne without actually saying anything.\n</youtube-link>\n\nBut for those that would rather read text, consider a cutscene like the following:\n\n- Alphen and Shionne, the male and female lead protagonists, just went through an intense experience, and Alphen is injured.\n- After some time to cool off, the two open up to each other a bit.\n- Shionne asks Alphen a pointed, emotional question\n- Alphen momentarily turns his back to Shionne while telling her how much he cares about her.\n- With his back turned, Shionne longingly reaches out to touch him.\n- Right before Alphen turns around, Shionne quickly and reluctantly pulls her arm back towards herself with a despondent look on her face.\n\nTruth be told, *this is a great cutscene*. It's able to convey how Shionne feels without actually saying anything, as you can clearly tell that she's *desperate* for human contact, and just wants to hold someone in a time of vulnerability and anxiety. But because of her condition (she hurts anyone she touches), as well as an emotional inability to let others in, she forces herself to remain stoic and detached.\n\nIn other words, this scene nails the Golden Rule of storytelling: [Show, Don't Tell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show,_don%27t_tell). It's much more satisfying to let viewers come to their own conclusions about characters, rather than being told through narration or exposition.\n\nSo, why bring this up? What's the problem with this game's script?\n\nThe problem is that, after this cutscene, you get *bombarded* with repetitive, clinical explanations as to how Shionne feels and what Shionne is thinking. You'll hear many different variations of \"Shionne longs for human touch, but her thorns are keeping her away from others\", and it grates a little more each time you hear it. All subtlety and nuance from the game's script is eventually discarded as you hear, for the 50th time, how Shionne feels.\n\nIt's also little insulting, as it suggests that you, the viewer, weren't smart enough to pick this up yourself from the cutscene. Instead, like a little schoolchild, the game beats you over the head with what it wants you to think and feel, over and over again.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/toa_skit.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">These optional scenes, called \"Skits\", are awkwardly animated and contain disposable, repetitive dialog. Skip them.</span>\n</div>\n\nIt's not just Shionne's feelings that get repeated, either: characters blather about *many* different topics, such as the difference between the game's two main civilizations (Dhana and Rena), the motivations of the game's heros and villains, what it means to be a slave and what it means to be free, etc, etc, etc. \n\nThese topics *are* interesting, but *Arise's* infantile, repetitive riffing on these topics will make most viewers' eyes glaze over as they hear, for the 20th time, what it means to be a free man amongst slaves.\n\nIn addition, the way that the characters talk about these concepts are lifeless and robotic. Prior *Tales* games had typically found great success with keeping the conversations between the main cast interesting and exciting. It was always entertaining to watch them bicker and banter with each other. But in Arise, aside from some interpersonal drama, characters don't argue about anything. They don't have different viewpoints. They don't even bother to debate, just for the fun of it.\n\nInstead, characters in *Arise* converse in stilted, forced speeches, finishing each other's sentences with pre-baked responses. For any given cutscene, it's as if the script writers took one big monologue, cut it up into parts, and distributed each part to several different characters. Characters simply regurgitate the same talking points about each of the game's themes (slavery, love, etc). In general, aside from very few exceptions, there's a serious lack of chemistry or spontaneity between the main cast.\n\nThis is made much worse by the fact that there's so...much...dialog...in this game. If they had cut half of the dialog out of the game, *Arise* would lose 10 hours of runtime and be all the better for it. But alas, unless you have an appetite as big as Shionne's for pointless dialog, you'll be forced to endure all of it and hate every minute.\n\n### Major Issue #3: Extreme Pacing Issues\nGiven the points above (long, tedious boss battles and a bloated script), *Arise* never seems respectful of the fact that we all have a limited amount of time on this beautiful, broken planet of ours. Instead, *Arise* takes 20-30 hours of actual content and stretches it to its absolute limits in order to make it 50-60 hours.\n\nConsider *Arise's* dungeons: *Tales* games typically have awful dungeons ([I've mentioned that in the past](https://nevermeant.dev/play-this-eternal-sonata)), but given *Arise's* promise of being an evolution of the series, I was hopeful it would turn things around. Instead, its dungeons are perhaps the worst in the series. They consist of nothing but narrow corridors, elevators, and room keys. The general pattern is: \n\n- Enter onto a new floor.\n- Go all the way to the end, fighting hordes of respawning enemies.\n- Discover that the path forward requires a magic key.\n- Backtrack into all of the rooms (which have respawned enemies by this point) and find the key.\n- Repeat this 1-3 times.\n- Fight a boss, and the dungeon is over.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/toa_map.jpg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">Every big square on this map contains multiple minibosses. There are about 10 floors in this dungeon. Excited yet?</span>\n</div>\n\nEspecially egregious are the last two dungeons. For reasons unknown, the 2nd-to-last dungeon doesn't allow fast-traveling *at all*, which means that you have to walk *all the way back* through the way you came. Oh, and of course, the enemies have all respawned. The last dungeon also doesn't allow fast travel until you've reached the very end. So if you die midway through this multi-hour dungeon, you'll have to start all over again. Did I mention this dungeon is multiple hours long?\n\nOr how about the game's boss-based sidequests? Each one features minibosses that you've mostly seen before, except they've been supercharged with higher damage output and *much* more health. It's no exaggeration to say that these types of sidequests take over 10 minutes to complete (assuming that you beat it on your first try).\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/toa_tower.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">A tower which simply requires you to run up its spiraling staircase to get to the top. The characters even comment on how long and boring of a climb it is. Does it count as irony when the tower is, in fact, really boring to climb up?</span>\n</div>\n\nThe game isn't even *hard*: it's simply a test of the player's patience and their will to continue in the face of monotony. Sure, you can crank the difficulty down a couple of notches and breeze through this game (something I was tempted to do), but that doesn't take away from the fact that this game is *filled* to the brim with repetition and filler. \n\nGiven its repetition and bloat, however, it was very frustrating to see *Arise* scramble to tie up all of its loose ends in the final act of the game. The game was perfectly content to take its sweet time with its grindy dungeons and inconsequential sidequests, but when the story takes a drastic turn, *Arise* hurriedly stumbles over itself to get things over with as quickly as possible. For example:\n\n- the game's *true* major conflict is revealed via a minutes-long story exposition dump. \n- a villain from many hours ago is revealed as the *true* final boss of the game, with no explanation as to how they survived or why they are so invested in thwarting our heros.\n- The boss fight ends as quickly as it begins, with little in the way of uniqueness or intrigue.\n\nAnd after you finish off the big bad guy for good, the game just...ends. Crumbs of a conclusion are scattered across the game's mid-credits montage, but nothing that I'd call \"satisfying\" or \"rewarding\".\n\nThis is especially awful because, by the end of the game, you'll come to the realization that there *is no payoff* for the long hours you've put into this game. None of the questions that *Arise* raised during its runtime were ever fully answered or addressed: will the freed Dhanan slaves *actually* function without a master? What will happen to Rena and the ancient civilization that inhabited it? Can Dhana and Rena peacefully coexist? Will Law and Rinwell kiss (a far more interesting couple than Alphen and Shionne)?\n\nInstead, after beating the final boss, *Arise* seems content to throw a clichéd, fanservicey bone to the player and close it curtains for good.\n\nIn summary, to call the game's ending \"rushed\" is an understatement, as it fails to reflect the extreme unevenness of the game's pacing: brisk at the beginning, sluggish and self-indulgent in the middle, and peckish and reclusive by the game's conclusion.\n\n## Summary\nFor a game that strikes all the right notes in its opening hours, it's incredibly disappointing to see it stumble and sputter across the finish line. If I had to guess what went wrong, I'd assume that it's a combination of the following:\n\n- Our dear friend COVID-19 making life a living hell for the game's designers and developers. According to Japanese culture experts, Japan was [especially unprepared](https://www.nippon.com/en/in-depth/a07602/) for the shift to work-from-home.\n- The shift from a familiar (albeit dated) in-house engine to Unreal Engine 4. This likely introduced growing pains and inefficiencies in *Arise's* development.\n- More than ever, games are *really* expensive to make. The *Tales* series is rather niche (at least in non-japanese countries), so I doubt that this game got the budget it needed.\n- In the minds of many JRPG gamers, games are worthless unless they are 40+ hours long. It's a misguided judge of quality, but quite often, fans of the genre will not consider games that fall under this arbitrary length.\n\nPerhaps the most redeeming quality of *Arise* is in its promise for future *Tales Of* games: *Arise's* aesthetic is superb, its voice actors are supremely talented, the battle system is great fun (until you get to the miniboss shift described above), and underneath the bloat, there's a compelling world with interesting characters. With these strong foundations, I can easily see Bandai Namco leveraging the great work that they've already done and improving upon *Arise's* failures to create an even-better successor. \n\nTo be clear, I'm a huge fan of the *Tales* series: there's nothing I want more than to see the series succeed on a worldwide scale. There's great potential in a sequel (spiritual or otherwise) to *Arise*, and I will be very eager to see what Bandai Namco does next with the series.\n\nBut on its own, *Arise* fails to live up to its \"Triple A, Big Budget\" premise. Here's hoping that *Tales of Arise 2: the Arise-ening* turns out a bit better than its predecessor.\n\n**Verdict: 2 Bloated Monologues Out of 5**","dir":"/articles","path":"/articles/tales-arise-review-flawed","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2025-05-23T02:54:32.428Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1749094363984},"$loki":14},{"slug":"essay","name":"Essay","toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[]},"text":"","dir":"/tags","path":"/tags/essay","extension":".md","createdAt":"2025-05-23T02:54:32.430Z","updatedAt":"2025-05-23T02:54:32.430Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1749094363985},"$loki":15},{"slug":"anime","name":"Anime","toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[]},"text":"","dir":"/tags","path":"/tags/anime","extension":".md","createdAt":"2025-05-23T02:54:32.430Z","updatedAt":"2025-05-23T02:54:32.430Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1749094363985},"$loki":16},{"slug":"howto","name":"How To","toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[]},"text":"","dir":"/tags","path":"/tags/howto","extension":".md","createdAt":"2025-05-23T02:54:32.431Z","updatedAt":"2025-05-23T02:54:32.431Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1749094363985},"$loki":17},{"slug":"gaming","name":"Gaming","toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[]},"text":"","dir":"/tags","path":"/tags/gaming","extension":".md","createdAt":"2025-05-23T02:54:32.431Z","updatedAt":"2025-05-23T02:54:32.431Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1749094363985},"$loki":18},{"slug":"xenoblade-chronicles-3-review-bloat","title":"A <i>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</i> Critique: Earnest, Complex, and Bloated","titleImage":"/xchero.jpg","summary":"The third game in this beloved series is packed with new features, landscapes, and stories to tell, but is ultimately weighed down by its lofty ambitions.","titleImageCaptionHTML":"I'm the guy with the gall...to fairly critique this game.","shouldShowTableOfContents":true,"shouldShowUpdatedAt":false,"createdAt":"2022-12-08T23:41:34.140Z","tags":["Gaming","Reviews","Essay"],"toc":[{"id":"disclaimers","depth":2,"text":"Disclaimers"},{"id":"introduction","depth":2,"text":"Introduction"},{"id":"outstanding-in-many-respects","depth":2,"text":"Outstanding in Many Respects"},{"id":"a-stunning-technical-achievement","depth":3,"text":"A Stunning Technical Achievement"},{"id":"a-mature-consistent-narrative","depth":3,"text":"A Mature, Consistent Narrative"},{"id":"an-unwieldy-but-incredibly-rewarding-battle-system","depth":3,"text":"An Unwieldy, But Incredibly Rewarding, Battle System"},{"id":"miscellaneous-goodness","depth":3,"text":"Miscellaneous Goodness"},{"id":"disappointing-in-many-respects","depth":2,"text":"Disappointing in Many Respects"},{"id":"a-conflicted-open-world-design","depth":3,"text":"A Conflicted Open-World Design"},{"id":"an-empty-unrewarding-world","depth":3,"text":"An Empty, Unrewarding World"},{"id":"a-time-consuming-grind","depth":3,"text":"A Time Consuming Grind"},{"id":"lifeless-characters","depth":3,"text":"Lifeless Characters"},{"id":"an-long-uneventful-story","depth":3,"text":"An Long, Uneventful Story"},{"id":"an-anti-climactic-conclusion","depth":3,"text":"An Anti-Climactic Conclusion"},{"id":"conclusion","depth":2,"text":"Conclusion"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"disclaimers"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#disclaimers","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Disclaimers"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Spoilers will be kept to a minimum, and major ones will be hidden with spoiler tags (hover over them to reveal them)."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I completed the game and finished the many of the game's sidequests.

It's not necessarily a *conclusion* to the beloved series, but can be considered [the end of the main story](https://nintendoeverything.com/monolith-soft-shares-xenoblade-chronicles-3-message-another-tease-of-the-future/) that started with *Xenoblade Chronicles* on the wii. \n\nIn other words, *Xenoblade Chroincles 3* is a stopping point. A resting place. A period in which the team and the fans can gather their thoughts, reflect on past experiences, and ponder where the series will go next. Xenoblade is not gone, but it's likely to go away for a while.\n\nSo, as ~the conclusion~ a stopping point for this beloved JRPG series, how does Monolith Soft's latest entry in the *Xenoblade Chronicles* series fare? \n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/xcmio.jpg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">It's been fun...at times...to analyze what went right, and what went wrong, with Xenoblade Chronicles 3.</span>\n</div>\n\n\nGiven that *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* takes a minimum of [62 hours to beat](https://howlongtobeat.com/game/103825), which doesn't include any <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'Xenoblade Chronicles 3\\'s extra content can easily add 30-40 hours to its runtime.'\">optional content</text-with-tooltip> or sidequests, there's no way that I'd be able to answer that question in a two-page essay. And since [game reviewers don't need to finish games anymore](https://twitter.com/raveofravendale/status/1496533451096440838?lang=en), I'd like to offer <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'No, I don\\'t think game reviewers need to sacrifice their health to review games, but I would think that seeing the end of a story would be important for reviewing a story-driven game.'\">my perspective</text-with-tooltip> as both a huge Xenoblade fan, and as someone who has spent a *lot* of time with this game.\n\n\nSo, much like *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* itself, I'm going to take *way too long* to tell you what I think and how I feel. I suppose I could consider this long review as revenge for the time I spent/enjoyed/wasted on *Xenoblde Chronicles 3*. This game is certainly a ride, but it's not necessarily a fun one from start to finish.\n\nLet's get started.\n\n## Outstanding in Many Respects\nIn case it wasn't clear, Monolith Soft's work on Nintendo's consoles has always been exceptional. The environments in *Xenoblade Chronicles 1* pushed Nintendo's aging Wii console to its limits, and *Xenoblade Chronicles 2* on the Nintendo Switch upped the ante in many respects. It's no surprise, then, that *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* continues that trend.\n\n### A Stunning Technical Achievement\n<div class=\"imageContainer imageUnderSection\">\n  <img :src=\"'/xc3gif.JPG'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">Occasionally, <i>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</i> makes you forget that you're playing a game on an underpowered mobile processor from 2017. This game's technical and artistic aspects are, at times, exceptional.</span>\n</div>\n\nBoth artistically and technically, this game is leaps and bounds ahead of anything else on the Switch. A quick comparison to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/pokemon.jpg\">this screenshot</a> of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, another first-party Nintendo game, should speak for itself.\n\nThe landscapes are vast, the lighting system is <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'Xenoblade Chronicles 2\\'s lighting system gave its characters an awful plastic-looking shine. In contrast, the lighting system in Xenoblade Chronicles 3 gives its characters a much more realistic-looking glow.'\">greatly improved</text-with-tooltip>, and there is a significant increase in the number of onscreen characters and enemies. More impressive is the fact that, despite all of these improvements, there's very little pop-in and <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'Level-Of-Detail culling involves using a lower-detailed version of an object when it is far from the player\\'s view.'\">LOD culling</text-with-tooltip> that many games nowadays tend to (ab)use.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/xcneon.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">In addition to the game's technical chops, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 makes intelligent use of neon colors to make environments pop.</span>\n</div>\n\nThese improvements aren't simply for the pixel-counters and the framerate snobs, though. Instead, I'd argue that these improvements help *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* feel like a *real, living universe*. Its biomes are teeming with personality and life, which helps evoke a nostalgic, childlike sense of adventure as players explore Aionios\n\nThis is important because exploration is a large part of *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*'s appeal: much of the player's time will be spent traversing the game's varied, ethereal landscapes. Despite a lack of any real secrets to discover or treasures to find (which I'll get to later), I'll admit that simply being able to observe the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/xc3vista.gif\">sun setting behind a vast expanse of distant mountains</a> for the first time was a real treat.\n\n### A Mature, Consistent Narrative\nLet's talk about *Xenoblade Chronicles 2*, this game's predecessor, for a second. Its critical reception was divisive in many respects, but being \"too anime\" was a common refrain from its detractors. Even though I take issue with <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'It implies that anime is inherently childish and silly, which is simply not true.'\">this phrase</text-with-tooltip>, I mostly agree with its sentiment: despite Xenoblade 2's attempts to establish a complex narrative that spans multiple universes, its efforts are undermined by the game's proclivity for [fanservice](https://gintendo-namer.squarespace.com/articles/2018/2/5/xenoblade-the-sjw-article), [penis jokes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMBRC1dHALY), [accidental boob touching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc-u936MOB4), and [ridiculous-looking outfits](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/xenoblade/images/6/64/XC2_Pyra_artwork.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20171110014440). This is made worse by a shoddy North American localization and some <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'Allegedly, the voice actors and actresses were on an extremely tight schedule, made worse by the fact that they were often given little direction as to what the appropriate tone for a scene should be.'\">absolutely *terrible*</text-with-tooltip> voice acting performances, which ensures that any attempts at humor land with a thud.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/xc2anime.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">A Xenoblade Chronicles 2 scene in which Pyra and Rex have just been introduced to Tora's maid-outfit-wearing robot <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">slave</span> \"companion\". Silly and fun? Maybe. Something you'd want to share with your coworkers? Definitely not.</span>\n</div>\n\nI'm not here to shame people for enjoying sexiness and silliness, but for a series like *Xenoblade Chronicles*, scenes like this are incongruous with the seriousness of the game's conflict. Is this an epic sci-fi novel, or a harem-style romantic comedy? <span class=\"spoiler\">As [this insanely-controversial](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/2408708-xenoblade-chronicles-3) end-game scene suggests, maybe it *is* the latter?</span>\n\n*Xenoblade Chronicles 3*, thankfully, swings the pendulum back towards *Xenoblade 1's* more-mature tone. The developers themselves have confirmed that this tone shift is intentional; regarding the character design process, they had this to say:\n\n<info-box :source-name=\"'Ask the Developer Vol. 6, XC3–Part 2'\" :source-link=\"'https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-6-xenoblade-chronicles-3-part-2/'\">\n[S]ince the story is more serious than the previous titles, we designed the characters to look more mature by making them taller. We also designed the costumes to be not too flashy to match the tone of the story. [...] We asked Saito-san to tailor the overall design, including the clothing, to a dignified style that fits a serious story. \n</info-box>\n\nIn other words, \"Saito-san, please give the characters clothes this time.\"\n\nThe game's opening cutscene makes this tone shift immediately apparent. As battles between Agnus and Keves soldiers rage on, the player is forced to bear witness to the terrible consequences of war. Wounded soldiers and rotting corpses litter the battlefield as Noah, the main protagonist, tells the audience of Aionios' terrible curse: they must fight to live, and they must live to fight. It's a <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'Well, as gruesome as it can possibly be for a T-rated game.'\">gruesome</text-with-tooltip> scene, reminding players that in the cruel world of Aionios, nobody wins and everybody loses.\n\nThis war-torn, dystopian life has clearly taken its toll on the game's main cast, who are afflicted with bouts of anxiety, despair, and hopelessness. Despite its fantasy setting, *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*'s characters endure struggles that may be all-too-familiar to the player, making these struggles feel real and, perhaps, personal. I'd be willing to bet that most of us have grappled with feelings of inadequacy, or a fear of death.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/xc3sad.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">At its best, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 hits incredibly hard.</span>\n</div>\n\nThat's not to say it's *all* doom and gloom, though. *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* smartly intersperses brief moments of levity between its heavier moments, allowing players to catch their breath before diving back into Aionios' harsh and desperate waters. But again, unlike *Xenoblde Chronicles 2*, these moments don't feel out of place in an epic sci-fi adventure, and don't resort to tired anime cliches in an attempt to connect with an audience.\n\nInstead, these moments in *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* are a little more grounded and mature, a little more tender and thoughtful. They lend humanity to the game's characters, who are simply trying to make light of their terrible existence. \n\nIn that sense, it's refreshing to see Monolith Soft take its universe a little more seriously. And even though there are major problems with this game's narrative and its characters (I'll get to that below), I'd argue that *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*'s more-mature tone is a step in the right direction.\n\n### An Unwieldy, But Incredibly Rewarding, Battle System\nThere's no denying it: *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*'s battle system is complicated. Perhaps a little *too* complicated. On top of that, the game introduces new wrinkles into the battle system as the player progresses, making it hard to settle into a comfortable groove until late in the game.\n\nThe game starts by introducing its core battle mechanics: auto-attacks, <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'Special moves that deal extra damage and effects.'\">Arts</text-with-tooltip>, character management (i.e. equipping accessories, leveling up, etc). The basics should click fairly quickly for those that have played RPGs before.\n\nThen, as players progress, the game introduces more mechanics: <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'Abilities that you can learn from and borrow from other classes.'\">Master Arts</text-with-tooltip>, <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'Performing two Arts at the same time, combining their effects'\">Fusion Arts</text-with-tooltip>, <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'Super-powered forms that characters can assume for a limited time.'\">Oroborous Forms</text-with-tooltip>, and <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'Stops time and allows players to attack enemies repeatedly.'\">Chain Attacks</text-with-tooltip>. I'll admit that the game's constant use of made-up RPG jargon was overwhelming at times, and despite the game's abundance of tutorials, I'd often not fully grasp <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'It took me several hours to realize that the the Ouroboros forms were best used as “Oh Shit! Don\\'t Die!” buttons. '\">the point</text-with-tooltip> of a mechanic until several hours later. And yes, the sheer volume and relentlessness of *Xenoblade Chronicles 2's* tutorials, [famously memed on by Dunkey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiVZMxf4E2Q), are back to pester the player.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer imageUnderSection\">\n  <img :src=\"'/xc3battle.jpg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">This screenshot will probably look bewildering to those unfamiliar with Xenoblade. There's lots to learn about Xenoblade Chronicles 3's battle system, but in my opinion, it's worth learning.</span>\n</div>\n\nBut during my playthrough, after about 25 hours, something awesome happened: the mental burden of *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*'s numerous mechanics began to ease, and I started to view these mechanics as tools instead of as sources of confusion. \n\nWhat do I mean by this? To give you some examples: want to turn Eunie, one of the game's default healers, into a critical-hit landing powerhouse? How about a tank that is frail but impossible to hit? Or maybe you'd rather put her in a support role that has insane synergies with one of your other attackers?\n\nUnlike other RPGs that punish players for straying *too* far from conventional strategies, *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* actively *encourages* it. The game urges players to constantly change characters' classes, and by doing so, characters can permanently learn a variety of unique and useful skills from other classes. For example, changing Lanz, the game's <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'A Tank is a term for a character in an RPG that is designed to pull enemies towards them, distracting them from attacking the group\\'s weaker party members'\">tank</text-with-tooltip>, into a healer will allow him to learn healing skills that he can carry with him *regardless* of his current class.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/xc3class.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">Changing classes is a great way to alleviate some of the tedium of using the same skills and abilities over and over. Plus, it allows characters to learn skills that they wouldn't otherwise be able to use.</span>\n</div>\n\n\n*Xenoblade Chronicles 3* explicitly tells players to change classes once a current class has reached its maximum level, and by doing so, most players will naturally realize how *fun and rewarding* it can be to experiment with the game's class system.\n\nAnother notable feature is what the game calls \"Fusion Arts\". This mechanic allows players to perform two arts at once, and when doing so, any secondary effects of these arts are combined and amplified. \n\nFor example, consider the following two arts: one that is an <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'Area-Of-Effect. In other words, the attack hits all enemies in an area.'\">AOE</text-with-tooltip> art, and one that puts enemies to sleep. By \"fusing\" these two arts together, the result would put all enemies in the surrounding area to sleep. Pretty cool, right? \n\nThe art fusions possibilities are endless. Want a fusion art that both <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'RPG-speak for an attack that ignores any damage reduction incurred from an enemy\\'s defenses.'\">pierces</text-with-tooltip> and lands critical hits? Or how about a fusion art that can buff your team and debuff an enemy at the same time? What about a fusion art that heals *twice*? All of these combinations are fair game in *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*, further proving my point that the only limit to the flexibility of this game's battle system is the player's own creativity.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/xc3fusion.jpg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">Xenoblade Chronicles 3's \"Fusion Art\" system opens the door for endless experimentations. While it can be a little overwhelming at first, it's incredibly satisfying to stumble on that perfect combination.</span>\n</div>\n\nAnd on a final note, the game doesn't *force* players to deal with this complexity. When switching classes, the game helpfully sets some sensible defaults for arts, accessories, fusions, etc. In that sense, the game accommodates both the tinkerers and the easy-riders.\n\nIn summary, yes, the game's mechanics can be initially bewildering. But I'd argue that there's nothing quite like spending a good 20 minutes finding the perfect combination of classes and Arts, and then *beating the absolute shit* out of a previously-troublesome boss. These moments can be exhilarating, vindicating any early struggles a player may have.\n\n### Miscellaneous Goodness\nWhile I want avoid making this review 100 pages, it wouldn't be fair for me to not mention the following:\n\n- As expected, *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*'s soundtrack is phenomenal. It's unlike anything else I've heard in a videogame. Its melodies are memorable and strong, but still manage to evoke the fantastical and the surreal.\n- While <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'In particular, Mio\\'s performance is pretty poor'\">not perfect</text-with-tooltip>, the voice acting from the main cast is *much* improved over its predecessor, sounding downright impressive at times.\n- Loading screens are kept to an absolute minimum. Combined with a snappy menu, it's a joy to play a game that can actually <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'Many games contain laggy, unresponsive menus that make even the simplest management actions a chore to perform.'\">keep up</text-with-tooltip> with the player's inputs.\n\n<youtube-link :src-link=\"'https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4pPMp1qZ6lY'\">Like the nighttime waters of Erythia Sea itself, this track is both haunting and beautifully serene.</youtube-link>\n\n## Disappointing in Many Respects\nIf you couldn't tell by now, there's a *lot* to love about *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*. But like the dual-natured world of Aionios, there is another side to *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*, one that is filled with tedious grinds, empty environments, and sleep-inducing dialog. I don't want to belabor the point, but I *do* think it's important to thoroughly justify my critiques instead of blithely stating, \"this game is bad. The characters are boring. The story is bad\".\n\nAllow me, then, to argue my points.\n\n### A Conflicted Open-World Design\nAs a series that is renowned for its massively explorable environments, I want to first take a look at *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*'s open world. At first glance, it definitely seems like lots of thought and care was put into its design: the terrain is varied, there are about a dozen different biomes, and there are plenty of callbacks to previous games in the series. With boatloads of icons to find on the game's minimap, the game certainly *presents* its world as \"open\", with a multitude of things to collect and discover.\n\nWhy, then, is the game so **unwilling** to let players explore it? For some reason, *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* constantly thwarts any attempt at exploration with the following:\n- Invisible walls blocking exploration until the current quest has been completed.\n- Absurdly high-leveled enemies waiting to <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'I don\\'t mind games using a passive approach to steer me in the right direction, but too often did my curiosity lead me to staring face to face with a Level 87 Repentant Gonzalez.'\">punish players</text-with-tooltip> with too much curiosity.\n- Dead ends and empty rooms. Only later will the player learn that this area will be used as a set piece for a future quest.\n- Hills, cliffs, and ropes that can only be traversed if the player has learned the requisite skill (i.e. the ability to climb vines). This is neither rewarding or fun; it instead feels like a ploy to waste the player's time by forcing them to constantly backtrack.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/xc3climb.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">Found some cool vines to climb while exploring? If you don't have the climb ability, then too bad! You'll have to turn around.</span>\n</div>\n\nDoes this sound like an open-world game to you?\n\nThe player is forced to endure this mockery of an open-world until about <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'My memory is hazy, so this may be the wrong chapter. Regardless, it takes a LONG time for the game to open up.'\">Chapter 5</text-with-tooltip>, which is when the game finally lets its guard down. There's no more invisible walls, all of the requisite climbing skills have been learned, and levels are likely high enough to take on most overworld enemies. So, the game is just a slow burn, right? Or as anime fans like to proclaim, \"bro, just complete the first few chapters, and then it gets good\"?\n\nWell, not quite. The problem is that it will take most players about **40 hours** to reach chapter 5. At this point, most players (like me) will already be burnt out from this game's lazy quest design, which mostly consists of <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'In other words, a quest that simply requires the player to travel to a specific point, kill a bunch of monsters, and then return to the quest-giver. In RPG-land, this is the defining example of lazy quest design'\">fetch quests</text-with-tooltip>.\n\nWorse still is the fact that most quests in *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* don't take advantage of its massive world, running the player through linear, uninteresting paths over and over again. *This* is why the introduction of the game's largest region, the Cadensia Region, didn't fill me with eagerness to explore its vast, endless sea. Instead, I was tempted to drop the game altogether.\n\nThis brings me to my next point.\n\n### An Empty, Unrewarding World\nOnce the game *does* open up, players will quickly learn that there's not really much to discover in Aionios. Sure, there are dozens of enemies wandering around the game's open areas, and the player's minimap is often covered with icons, suggesting a litany of people and things to find.\n\nSo, I suppose that \"nothing to discover\" isn't technically accurate. But I *can* say that there's nothing *useful* or *interesting* to find.\n\nThis is partially because, unlike past games, almost everything in the world of Aionios is marked on the game's map, removing the mystery and wonder of exploration. And once players have found an item or event, the corresponding map marker disappears. So, when there's no icons left on the minimap, that's a cue to players that there's nothing left to discover. \n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/xc3minimap.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">The minimap is almost <i>too</i> helpful at times, removing the need for players to actually learn the game's topography.</span>\n</div>\n\nSure, one could argue that this is a time-saving mechanic, but I'd argue that by removing the mystery of exploration, the incentive to explore vanishes. It certainly did for me, at least. Imagine if *Zelda: Breath of the Wild* conveniently marked every fairy fountain, shrine, and Korok seed on its minimap. It would totally change the experience, and arguably for the worse.\n\nThe other reason is that, despite the myriad of icons on the minimap, there's really only three things that the player can find:\n\n1. Colonies\n2. Item Containers\n3. Unique Overworld Monsters\n\n*Xenoblade Chronicles 3*'s colony system is half-baked, being a terrible substitute for the kinds of <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'Remember Torigoth from Xenoblade Chronicles 2, or Colony 9 from Xenoblade 1? Xenoblade Chronicles 3\\'s colonies feel desolate by comparison.'\">cities</text-with-tooltip> traditionally featured in RPGs. This is because the game's colonies are practically identical; other than having a different item shop, a different Hero, and a different backdrop, there's nothing to distinguish the colonies from each other. Sure, one colony might be in a cave, and another atop a snowy mountain, but functionally, they're identical. In fact, during my playthrough, I'd frequently get colonies confused, fast traveling to one when I meant to go to another. \n\nThe game initially makes a big deal out of these colonies, urging players to maximize each colony's \"affinity chart\". But to me, there's no reason to care about these charts because, proportionally, the rewards are absolutely meager compared to the work required for them. Think \"Increased Swimming Speed\" is an adequate reward for completing several lengthy fetch quests? No, not even close. And the \"relationships\" built between each colony's citizens mostly consist of nothing more than a handful of unvoiced text lines.\n\nWorse, these colonies contain about [a dozen or so NPCs](https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/Colony_Iota), making the world of Aionios feel positively tiny. To me, it felt as if there were no more than 100 people, total, living in Aionis. I don't care if the sparseness of the colonies is \"story-relevant\"; it's a direct contradiction to the \"wide open world\" image that the game desperately tries to convey. \n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/xc3colony.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">A couple of tents, a cafeteria, and some metallic structures and barricades. Sure, one colony might be in the snowy mountains, and another might be in a cave, but they all look like this.</span>\n</div>\n\nSo, since the colony system in *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* is lackluster, what about these \"Item Containers\"? At least players are rewarded with sweet loot, right?\n\nNot exactly. These containers dispense <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'Ugh, why must every game have a crafting system. I suspect that it helps in padding a game\\'s runtime?'\">crafting materials</text-with-tooltip>, gemstones, and gold, with each one being useless in its own way:\n\n- the requirements for crafting are so random and arbitrary that the chance of actually getting useful materials is incredibly slim.\n- The amount of gemstones that a player need is actually capped to the couple hundreds. I reached the max amount after about 30 hours, so every subsequent gemstone I found was unceremoniously auto-sold.\n- Gold is only used to buy accessories, and in my playthrough, the accessories on sale were *never* better than what I currently had equipped. Gold is so useless that it makes me think that Monolith Soft simply forgot about it during development.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that there was only a *single* time that I managed to find something useful in one of these containers: a unique accessory. And sure enough, after some research, I found that there's only [7 of these special containers in the entire game](https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/Container). Given that there's hundreds of these containers in *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*, the chances of the player finding anything worthwhile in these containers is incredibly tiny.\n\nSo, when everything is marked on the map, and 99% of what a player will find is disposable or uninteresting, there really isn't a compelling reason for the player to spend any time exploring Aionios. *This* is why Cadensia Region's grand reveal was dread-inducing instead of exciting. I wasn't thinking, \"Yay! I get to explore!\", but rather, \"Oh god, let's get this over with\".\n\nBut what about the battle system that I heavily praised? Beating down tough bosses can be its own reward, right?\n\n### A Time Consuming Grind\nDespite *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* making an honest effort to respect the player's time (auto saving, auto selling, a great navigation system, etc), this effort feels entirely absent from some of game's other elements. This omission is most noticeable during the game's bloated, lengthy battles.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/xc3chain.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">Chain attacks are useful, party-saving maneuvers, but are a chore to execute. Worse, they tack on an extra 5-10 minutes to each battle.</span>\n</div>\n\nMake no mistake: I stand by my previous praise for the game's battle system. It's a wonderfully complex system that rewards careful study and patience, but is also flexible enough to accommodate most playstyles. The game's first half can be thrilling at times because both the party *and* the enemy have relatively tiny reserves of HP, which makes battles are brisk and exciting. Witnessing a huge swath of enemy HP disappear after executing a powerful attack was always satisfying, making me feel like my battle-time decisions had an impact.\n\nBut unfortunately, towards the latter half of the game, battles become a test of *patience*, rather than skill. Starting around chapter 5, unique monsters and bosses are given disproportionate buffs to their HP and lethality. Gone is the satisfaction from landing a powerful blow, as even the most powerful attacks deplete only a sliver of HP. As a result, many battles drag on for an upwards of 5-8 minutes, with boss/legendary monster battles taking around 10-15 minutes. I'm not joking. And that's **if** players beat a boss on their first try.\n\nSince enemies become so resilient and lethal in the latter half of the game, \"Chain Attacks\" become both the only way to deal any significant damage (making the combo system practically useless), and the only way to survive (by stopping lethal blows and giving yourself time to heal). \n\nThe problem with the Chain Attack system, however, is that it *stops time*. In theory, this is good because it allows the player to craft the perfect sequence of 20-30 attacks, ensuring high damage output. But in practice, it's *terrible* because one Chain Attack takes about 3 minutes to execute. Since most bosses will require about 2-3 chain attacks to defeat, the average length of a boss battle will approach 20-25 minutes, which is *simply far too long*.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/xc3blong.jpg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">The game's Consul boss battles towards the later half of the game are particularly grueling.</span>\n</div>\n\nAs a result, instead of being eager to take on higher-leveled enemies as I progressed, I was eager to *avoid* them. But true to its JRPG roots, many quests require the player to trudge through narrow passageways filled with endless, respawning hordes enemies, so an avoidance strategy isn't really feasible. This is ramped up to an unbearable degree for the last 10 hours of *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*, making it one of the worst segments in a video game that I've played this year.\n\nSo, at this point, I've established that the game's \"open world\" is a unrewarding chore to traverse, and the game's battle system crumbles under the weight of a poorly-balanced second half of the game. What, then, does that leave for the player to enjoy?\n\nThis a JRPG, right? Surely its story and characters are wacky, zany, and fun?\n\n### Lifeless Characters\nRather than discuss the plot, I first want to discuss *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*'s characters because **it's the characters, not the plot, that are the most important elements of a good story**. The most interesting premise in the world wouldn't be able to save a story with lifeless characters. Inversely, some of the best games/shows of our generation have paper-thin plots, and are carried by their likable characters and nuanced portrayals of human behavior (i.e. the works of [Shinchiro Watanabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop)). \n\nWhile this topic deserves a separate essay, I'll spare you the details and leave you with a brilliantly-concise quote on the importance of characters in a story:\n\n<info-box :source-name=\"'How to Develop a Fictional Character: 6 Tips for Writing Great Characters'\" :source-link=\"'https://www.masterclass.com/articles/writing-tips-for-character-development'\">While a mastery of plot can help you develop exciting twists and turns, great character development draws readers in by giving them strong characters with whom they can identify.[...] Character and plot are inseparable, because a person is what happens to them. Without a clear sense of who a character is, what they value, and what they’re afraid of, the reader will be unable to appreciate the significance of your events, and your story will have no impact.</info-box>\n\nIn that sense, the way that characters behave and develop is critically important in getting the audience invested in a story. They must be both realistic yet interesting, unique yet relatable, active yet contemplative. When a likable character falls, we feel pain. When a likable character triumphs, it's as if *we've* triumphed, too.\n\n*Xenoblade Chronicles 3*, unfortunately, fails its characters in the worst way possible, and it's not because they're annoying, unlikeable, or poorly voice-acted. No, *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*'s fails because its main characters are some of the most robotic, lifeless, and bland characters of any game that I've played in the past 10 years. The best way that I can describe them is **unbearably inoffensive**.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/xcboring.jpg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">Like many JRPGs, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 doesn't seem to understand the concept of <a href=\"https://self-publishingschool.com/show-dont-tell-writing/\">Show, Don't Tell</a></span>\n</div>\n\nThis is not, however, immediately apparent in the opening hours of *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*: the game's first 5-10 hours contain several charming, nuanced cutscenes that show off the colorful sides of the game's main cast. I'll admit that, similar to *Tales of Arise*, <NuxtLink to=\"/tales-arise-review-flawed\" target=\"_blank\">another JRPG that I've reviewed</NuxtLink>, I was fooled into thinking that I was getting myself into a gripping, character-driven narrative.\n\nThe game continues this charade by making each member of the main cast a little \"broken\" in some way. For example, Eunie has PTSD from a previous encounter with a villain. Taion lives with shame because he blames himself for the death of his ~~crush~~ friend. Sena's desperation for acceptance from her peers has made her lose her sense of self. Most of *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*'s characters have some \"quirk\" like this that gives off an illusion of depth and nuance.\n\nIn that sense, *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* certainly plants the seeds for compelling character arcs, but unfortunately, we don't get to see the process by which these seeds blossom. Instead (to continue this silly metaphor), players stare at these seeds for 80 hours until, *poof*, they suddenly become giant oak trees.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/xc3sena.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">Xenoblade Chronicles 3 spends a lot of time telling us that Sena's psyche is overly-reliant on praise and validation from others, but this is completely irrelevant to her part in the game's story.</span>\n</div>\n\nFor example, the characters *tell us* that Mio is troubled about her impending 10-year death, but we never see that fear play out (in fact, the game's diary motif is randomly used, and never in a compelling way). The characters *tell us* about Taion's guilt, but it never factors into his decision making (aside from some minor events in an entirely-optional side quest). The characters *tell us* that Lanz is torn up over a betrayal from one of his long-time friends, but this never affects his behavior or his attitude towards his other friends. \n\nThese characters claim to be \"broken\", despite not acting like it. Instead, each character is intelligent, rational, trusting, and kind, but the game tries to tell players something to the contrary. Repeatedly and endlessly. It *tells* us, but never *shows* us.\n\nIn addition to lacking any sort of believable character development, *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*'s characters don't *behave* like humans, either: they never debate, and they never disagree. They always assume the best intentions, and they never hold grudges. \n\nDespite having 6 characters with which to create interesting group dynamics, the game plays things as safely and as boring as possible. Aside from one bizarre moment where Mio unexplainably gets angry at Noah (and then quickly forgives him), there's no tension or drama between them to speak of.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/xcconvo.jpg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">It may not be apparent at first, but most of the game's dialog is delivered via unvoiced, awkwardly-animated scenes filled with text boxes.</span>\n</div>\n\nBut...shouldn't there be? If multiple universes were on the brink of total annihilation, and the world's citizens were forced into servitude, don't you think the game's protagonists might have different opinions on how to handle this? Don't you think that they'd get a little hot-headed at times? Don't you think that tensions would rise, feelings would get hurt, and emotional scars would be formed? \n\nMost importantly, don't you think that being introduced to the concepts of <span class=\"spoiler\">babies and sex</span> would drastically alter the dynamics between six young adults?\n\nMonolith Soft doesn't seem to think so. Instead, *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* is content to *tell* us how this long journey has changed these characters, instead of demonstrating this to its players in any meaningful way.\n\nSo, when *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*'s players characters repeatedly chirp that they've \"changed\" by the game's conclusion, these proclamations ring hollow because the game hasn't given its audience any reason to believe it. In reality, they haven't changed one bit: they're the same logical, cool-headed people that they've always been. This makes *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*'s characters feel like walking plot devices, rather than relatable human beings.\n\nThis is exacerbated by a wonky, uneven localization. At times, characters don't even properly respond to direct questions, and non-sequiturs are frequent throughout the game's script. It's almost as if the game's japanese script was thrown through a Japanese-to-English translator program and then slightly touched up, rather than organically written by a human being. It's most apparent when the game tries to wax philosophical, using strange metaphors and clunky phrasing that elicit wincing, rather than pondering.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/xcflute.jpg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">Xenoblade Chronicles 3 fumbles this moment with robotic dialog and lifeless character interactions.</span>\n</div>\n\nWhat, then, did I feel for the game's main cast as the end credits began to roll? Honestly, not much. I couldn't see myself, or anyone else for that matter, in Noah or Mio. So when they persevered, I felt nothing.  \n\nIn all honesty, I'm *just barely* able to restrain myself from saying that I prefer Xenoblade Chronicles 2's obnoxious cast of characters to this crew. Sure, those characters suffered from terrible writing and one-dimensionality, *but at least they were fun*.\n\nAlso, notice that I haven't touched on the game's \"Hero\" characters, since most of them are only obtained through optional side quests. This means that, outside of the one or two quests that directly pertain to a given Hero, the player won't hear a peep out of them for the rest of the game. These Hero characters are, quite literally, irrelevant to plot. And since they're mostly optional, their relationships with the main cast don't amount to anything significant, either.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/xc3isurd.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"text--secondary\">Isurd wins the award for least interesting character in the game. It doesn't help that his voice actor sounds as if he's just woken up from a nap.</span>\n</div>\n\nBefore you reach for your keyboard to angrily exclaim \"OMG are you an idiot??? What about *THIS* scene?!?!\", *yes*, there are occasional sparks of life in *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*'s characters, and those sparks sometimes shine *very* brightly. In particular, the \"jail\" cutscene is one of the most heart-wrenching, masterfully-crafted cutscenes in the entire Xenoblade franchise. There's also a <text-with-tooltip :tooltip=\"'It\\'s the scene where Taion notices that Eunie\\'s hands are shaking.'\">touching scene</text-with-tooltip> between Taion and Eunie that suggests that someone at Monolith Soft *might* understand the concept of \"Show, don't tell\". And finally, yes, Eunie can be a hoot.\n\nBut ultimately, these glimmers of humanity get absolutely crushed under this game's 60 hours of tactless, repetitive noise, making it impossible to truly connect with any of these characters. For a studio that obviously [spent a lot of time designing the ultra-likeable Shulk](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/08/random-xenoblade-chronicles-shulk-cutscene-was-originally-a-little-creepy) from *Xenoblade Chronicles*, I was shocked at how indifferent I was to Noah and Mio.\n\n### An Long, Uneventful Story\nI've mentioned a few times that *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* is a *long* game. This isn't necessarily a problem, as many great games from this generation have long runtimes. Whether it's because of a compelling gameplay loop or an exciting storyline, games like *Zelda: Breath of the Wild*, *Skyrim*, and *The Witcher 3* prove that it's possible to captivate audiences for dozens of hours.\n\nUnfortunately, the same cannot be said for *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*. I reached the end of the game about a month ago, and yet I'm sitting here, struggling to recall what *actually happened* in its story. Sure, players will learn more about the *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* universe and its characters over the course of the narrative, but there's surprisingly little activity over the game's 60 hour runtime. Or at least, activity that involves *the player*.\n\nOff the top of my head, I can only think of <span class=\"spoiler\">blowing up the big world-destroying laser, reaching The City, going to Prison, getting a random key from Nia, and fighting Consul Z</span>. That's it. Now, try to imagine how *on earth* this game can stretch these events over the span of 60 hours. Obviously, it can't.\n\nInstead, outside of the game's opening act, nothing really happens until players hit the 30 hour mark. And at that point, the game squanders all of its narrative momentum, sending the player on dozens of sleep-inducing fetch quests and having them sit through stilted, voiceless cutscenes.\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/xc3text2.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">Xenoblade Chronicles 3 devotes way too much time to its side characters. Some could call it \"world-building\", but given how uninteresting they are, I'd call it \"filler\".</span>\n</div>\n\nPart of the problem, I think, is that <span class=\"spoiler\">most of the events integral to *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*'s plot have *already happened* by the time the player picks up a controller. Noah has already impregnated Mio and succumbed to the dark side, Melia and Nia have already constructed Origin and left to take naps, and Consul Z has already set his plan in motion for \"the endless now\".</span>\n\nOne of the hardest challenges for a story that is focused on <span class=\"spoiler\">the past lives of its characters is that, when the story mostly focuses on the past, it doesn't leave a lot of room for the present. *Zelda: Breath of the Wild* shares this issue with *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* in that the player isn't an active agent for most of the story's narrative events.</span> So, instead of being an active participant in major plot events, *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* has player wait on the sidelines until the dust has settled, making them feel disconnected from the narrative's progression.\n\nFor example, Ethel and Cammuravi supposedly have a long, storied rivalry? Supposedly, Crys was incredibly inspiring to Noah when he was younger? Supposedly, everybody has always loved Joran? Really?\n\nI don't care how many sepia-toned flashbacks the game throws at me: telling an audience to care about characters, but not spending the time or effort to develop those relationships organically, is a terrible way to tell a story.\n\nThis is why *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*'s length is so baffling to me: it clearly has no problem asking the player to spend 60+ hours on it. But in return, the player has practically nothing to show for it, narratively speaking, by the game's conclusion. \n\nI won't even get into the number of plot threads that the game's ending never addresses (i.e. *who*, exactly, is Riku?). I sincerely hope that this is due to a rushed development process, rather than a ploy to get players to buy additional DLC down the line.\n\n### An Anti-Climactic Conclusion\nOn one final note, as a *Xenoblade* series fan, I can't help but mention how disappointing *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*'s ending is. I'll admit that this criticism isn't relevant for those that haven't played Xenoblade Chronicles 1 or 2, but I think it deserves to be said.\n\nXenoblade Chronicles 1 ended with a huge, earth-shattering twist that <span class=\"spoiler\">recontextualized</span> its entire plot. Similarly, Xenoblade 2 <span class=\"spoiler\"> obscured its connection to its predecessor until the very end, greatly expanding on the series' lore and providing major contextual twists of its own.</span> \n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/xc2.jpg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">For those that played Xenoblade Chronicles 2, I'm sad to report that there's no equivalent scene like this in Xenoblade Chronicles 3.</span>\n</div>\n\nBut unlike its predecessors, *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* stumbles and sputters over the finish line. There's hardly any lore revelations, and there aren't any major twists (that aren't painfully obvious). \n\nInstead, the game simply wraps itself up as timidly and as conservatively as possible. In fact, I'd argue that the ending veers *dangerously close* to the <span class=\"spoiler\">\"It was all a dream! Or...was it?\"</span> trope, although I suppose that one could argue for [more nuanced interpretation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXQ7X7UMVMo). \n\nStill, in the context of its predecessors, it's shocking to me that <span class=\"spoiler\">, almost literally, </span> almost nothing happens by the end of the game. I understand that the developers wanted to keep this game somewhat self-contained rather than assume players have played previous games in the series, but they went completely overboard in this regard. \n\nDon't even get me started on the game's contrived, totally-unearned <span class=\"spoiler\">kiss between Mio and Noah. I recognize that it's against the law to *not* have JRPG male and female protagonists fall for each other, but this particular romance felt especially inorganic and completely forced.</span>. \n\nI suppose that I'm probably coming across as an \"entitled gamer\", but honestly, I expected more from this series. Hell, the only reason I put 100 hours into this game was because of a faint hope that, like its predecessors, *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*'s conclusion would rock my world.\n\nIn short: this game is bad. The characters are boring. The story is bad. The End.\n\n## Conclusion\nI kid, I kid. It seems like the more I think about this game's wasted potential, the more frustrated I get, hence the increasingly-angry tone towards the end of this review.\n\nBut wow, that's a whole lot of words. Still with me? \n\nMaybe I've taken things too far. Maybe a game like *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* doesn't need a 20,000 page essay. Maybe it's simply meant to be appreciated for what it is: a sophomoric work that has some serious mechanical and technical merits, but hasn't outgrown its awkward JRPG roots. Maybe it deserves to be loved, warts and all, for what it sets out to do?\n\n<div class=\"imageContainer\">\n  <img :src=\"'/xc3end.jpeg'\"/>\n  <span class=\"titleImageCaption text--secondary\">If nothing else, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 succeeds it sets high expectations for Xenoblade Chronicles 4.</span>\n</div>\n\nThat's certainly a valid viewpoint; I would never take that away from someone, since that's how I feel about *Xenoblade Chronicles 2*. I would never call that game a \"perfect game\", but it *is* one of my favorites. Unfortunately, I can't say the same thing about *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*, but maybe others *can*.\n\nStill, for all the things that *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* does wrong, there's enough good stuff here to make it a game worth playing (depending on your tastes and tolerances, of course). It's also exciting to consider *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* as a stepping stone towards something great. Fantastic, even.\n\nHopefully, Monolith Soft will be granted more time, a bigger budget, better hardware, and a pandemic-free environment when they start their next adventure. \n\nUntil then, I'll be eagerly waiting, listening to *Xenoblade Chronicles 3*'s soundtrack in the meantime.\n\n**Verdict: 3 Rare Doodads Out of 5**\n\n<youtube-link
