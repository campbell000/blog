Well, the term \"unix-like\" should give the answer away: in my opinion, MacOS is NOT a substitute for developing, building, and testing on a real linux distribution. If your target platform is a mac, then great, write all of your code and build scripts on a mac. But if your target platform is linux, much of the code you've written to build out and maintain your environment (i.e. install libraries, configure databases, etc) will not be portable to your actual application servers. Whereas if you use a linux platform all the way through, the portability of your code increases. Your development environment buildout code will never be 100% portable, but I'd argue that the closer you can get your development environment to your actual application servers, the better."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"So why not just install a linux VM on Mac?
